Deyjah Harris makes her age known in her Instagram bio, but that doesn’t prevent some creeps from coming to her page. She took to social media last week and posted a few pictures of herself showboating her makeup, sleek tresses and fly ‘fits.

In one particular photo of herself, the teenager donned a cropped long-sleeve sweater that showed her stomach and a pair of denim jeans."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Photo: @princess_of_da_south/Instagram)</p><p>A an apparent male fan skulking in the teen’s comments vocalized his disapproval of her looks.</p><p>“Females like this is why n—– go to jail,” the reprobate wrote. “We gotta make a law where chicks can’t use makeup til they 18. I’m tired of this s—t.”</p><p>Harris, who seemed to be over the Instagram user’s comments, clapped back at him for justifying the actions of men who prey on underage girls.</p><p>“N—– go to jail because they pigs, and aren’t right in the head, not because someone is wearing makeup,” the teenager fired back at the detractor. “You think I’m not supposed to wear makeup because of n—– and their perverted mind? Man&nbsp;🖕 y’all!!!! I don’t live for y’all nor do I wear makeup for y’all.”</p><p>She continued blasting the man for his creepy way of thinking.</p><p>“This comment is quite imbecile and shows a lot about you and your way of thinking. We gotta make a law where irrelevant a– men just leave women alone, mind their business, and more importantly stay in their place. Have a bless and highly favored day,” she said.</p><p>Fans underneath Harris’ comments came in with mixed reactions to both the teenager’s and her detractor’s remarks.</p><p>“He’s a perv amd you need to block him,” one fan said, siding with Harris. “You’re absolutely beautiful 😍😘 sweetheart let no man or woman define u baby girl….. U told him.”</p><p>A second user who seemed to agree with the critic added, “@princess_of_da_south he right tho. You a Lil a– girl looking GROWN. Go jump rope.”</p><p>One fan who raced to the teen’s defense added, “I just know this grown-rusty-assed man is not on a known-seventeen year old’s page…speaking on what she should not wear nor look like so as to CONTROL HIMSELF from his alleged primal mannish urges. Instead of being on this child’s page ….you ought to be in church and a support group pedophiles!”</p><p>The 17-year-old often posts images of herself dolled up in different outfits due to her job as a model for several clothing brands including Fashion Nova and Chnge. Rapper T.I. is extremely protective of his daughter and often flies into protective dad mode. The 17-year-old posted a recent photo of herself that she described as “untouchable.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-483667 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/T.I.-600x503.png alt="Deyjah Harris" width=600 height=503 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-483667 class=wp-caption-text>Deyjah Harris.
