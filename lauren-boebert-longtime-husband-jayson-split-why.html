"I feel the people should know the truth of our broken marriage and burden she has carried for too long," he wrote in a September 18, 2023&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a> post. Jayson asked the public to cut Lauren some slack while taking the blame for their divorce, describing how his own behavior drove her over the edge.&nbsp;"I take full responsibility for my actions, and I deeply regret the choices I made that led to the breakdown of our marriage," he noted. "I was unfaithful to Lauren in so many ways."</p><p>Jayson didn't elaborate on the nature of his unfaithfulness, but Lauren also used the term amid the divorce news. "I've always been faithful in my marriage, and I believe strongly in marriage, which makes this announcement that much more difficult," she said in a statement to <a href=#>The Denver Post</a> in May. Jayson denied the rumors surrounding why Lauren filed for divorce. "It upsets me that everyone believes she left me over fame or a new lifestyle. That is far from the truth," he said.</p><p>Even though he takes responsibility, Jayson was still caught off-guard when he was served his divorce papers. "The divorce is sad, I did not expect this, I love her with every bit of my heart, she has been my soul mate," he told the<a href=#>&nbsp;Daily Beast</a> in a text message in May 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgZ4J5go6lmK6qlaN6o7vEm5yrrF2hvK%2Bz06KknmWYqsCjrc2dZKOZqai8r3nSqaOirF2stbp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
