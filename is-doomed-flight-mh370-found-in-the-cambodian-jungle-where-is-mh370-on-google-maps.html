Taking off from Kuala Lumpur, the plane become en route to Beijing carrying 227 passengers and 12 team participants. Everything appeared everyday until a handover among Malaysian and Vietnamese air-visitors controllers. At that point, the aircraft’s transponder was inexplicably shut down, and the plane disappeared from radar. Since then, the thriller surrounding its fate has captivated worldwide attention and left households of the passengers and team in search of solutions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ian Wilson’s Startling Claim</strong></h2><p>Enter Ian Wilson, a tech expert who believes he’s uncovered a crucial lead via Google Maps. Wilson spent countless hours combing through the application and alleges that the plane’s remains lie deep within a Cambodian jungle. According to the Mirror, he stated, “Measuring the Google sighting, you’re looking at around 69 metres…” indicating that the dimensions roughly align with that of the missing aircraft. This dark, verdant spot on Google Earth, dated 2018, could potentially be the final resting place of MH370. The Bureau of Aircraft Investigations Archives, after reviewing his claim, has not dismissed it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Debris and the Barnacle Clue</strong></h2><p>While Wilson’s claim is a significant development, another lead has surfaced. Debris from the plane, specifically a flaperon, washed ashore on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean a year post the plane’s disappearance. This debris presented a unique avenue of investigation: barnacles. Barnacles, marine creatures known to attach themselves to submerged objects, were found on the plane debris. Their unique growth patterns could potentially offer clues to the plane’s journey after it disappeared.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The University of South Florida’s Investigation</strong></h2><p>Gregory Herbert, an associate professor of evolutionary biology at the University of South Florida, recognized the potential significance of these barnacles. His primary assertion is that the shells of barnacles grow daily and the chemistry of each layer reflects the water’s temperature at the time. By analyzing this data, scientists might be able to backtrack the movement of these sea creatures, and in turn, the debris they were attached to. Herbert noted, “As soon as I saw that, I immediately began sending emails to the search investigators because I knew the geochemistry of their shells could provide clues to the crash location.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h2><p>Despite years of investigations, the fate of MH370 stays one of the aviation world’s most big enigmas. The 1,500-web page record detailing the investigation yielded no conclusive outcomes. Both the Google Maps lead and the barnacle data represent promising avenues that might finally provide answers to the lingering questions surrounding this tragic event. As technological and scientific advancements continue, the hope remains that one day, the mystery of MH370 will be fully unraveled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH94hJdooKxllKS8rrHDZp2loZedwW65x2xuaWWWpMKvsIyipWasmJp6pK3Mm6adoZGjeqvBzaCjnmWnnbKzsYyiqmalmGiEcXnOp2Sgp5%2BcuaZ5zJqnrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
