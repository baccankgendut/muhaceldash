She's fantastic.</p><p>Brad sings too many gimmicky songs. His voice is nasal but not distinctive. He's no Randy Travis or Alan Jackson. And the skinny boy with the 10 gallon hat and porn moustache is not a look I like. He's almost 50. Time to get better or hang up the hat.</p><p>Carrie Underwood is a Democrat, as are Faith and Tim, Trisha and Garth and probably Reba and Dolly. Maren Morris and Kacey Musgraves for sure. But the guys of country music - who knows. I'd like to think that Blake Shelton and Stefani aren't Trump supporters - but we'll never know.</p><p>Kelly Clarkson is very much a Democrat, but another one who won't say so with so many jobs on the line.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 16</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 31, 2020 7:27 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Brad has hair - he's not fraudulent like those other dudes.

Are his good looks exceptional? No. But he's a nice looking guy. He looks lean and from R18's photo -- he looks like he has a receding hairline. So what?</p><p>More important -- he looks like a fun guy, who makes his wife feel special.
