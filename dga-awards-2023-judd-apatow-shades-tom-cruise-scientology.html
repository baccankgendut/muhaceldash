Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick was nominated for a prize at the 2023 Directors Guild of America Awards, and host Judd Apatow couldn’t resist a few shady jokes at the actor’s expense.
“The special effects in Maverick were so top-notch, I couldn’t even see the stack of phone books Tom Cruise sat on to reach the flight controls,” Apatow, 55, quipped in his Saturday, February 18, monologue, per Variety, referring to the 60-year-old actor’s height."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Someone needs to explain to him something called CGI. You’re 60. Calm down. But every time <a href=#>he does one of these new stunts</a>, it does feel like an ad for Scientology. I mean, is that in Dianetics? Because there’s nothing about jumping off a cliff in the Torah.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Glen-Powell-Reveals-the-Advice-Tom-Cruise-Gave-Him-While-Filming-Top-Gun-Maverick-2.jpg><p class=p1>Cruise, who has not publicly addressed Apatow’s DGA Awards remarks, first <a href=#>joined the Church of Scientology in 1987</a> amid his marriage to first ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Mimi Rogers</strong></a>. (After the couple’s split, he was briefly married to <a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> before moving on with Holmes, 44.)</p><p class=p1>“It’s something that has helped me incredibly in my life. I’ve been a Scientologist for over 30 years,” Cruise <a href=#>previously gushed about the religion</a> during an October 2015 interview with ITV News. “It’s something, you know, <a href=#>without it, I wouldn’t be where I am</a>. So it’s a beautiful religion. I’m incredibly proud.”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Jerry Maguire&nbsp;</i>star has remained steadfast in his beliefs, <a href=#>his involvement with the controversial religion</a> has made waves through the years.</p><p class=p1>“I think it’s time for people to start waking up to the real facts here. Tom has for years manipulated his image to be the good guy,” <a href=#><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a>, who<a href=#> famously left the Church in 2013</a>, <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in a July 2020 statement</a>. “Although I believe there was a time when Tom was a decent and kindhearted person, he has morphed himself into&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>David Miscavige</strong>&nbsp;</a>[the leader of Scientology] and is completely dedicated to Scientology’s mission to ‘clear’ planet Earth — which means making 80 percent of the world’s population into Scientologists.”</p><p class=p1>Apatow’s Saturday remarks about the controversial group are not the first time that Cruise’s religion <a href=#>has been the fodder for an awards show joke</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Backstage I found these three Golden Globe awards that Tom Cruise returned,” <a href=#><strong>Jerrod Carmichael</strong></a> said <a href=#>at the Globes last month</a>, referring to the trophies that<a href=#> the&nbsp;<i>Top Gun&nbsp;</i>star</a> gave back to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in 2021 amid controversy about lack of diversity. “I have a pitch. I think, maybe, we take these three [trophies] and exchange them for the safe return of&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Shelly Miscavige</strong></a>.”</p><p class=p1>Remini, 52, previously claimed that Shelly — who is the wife of <a href=#>Scientology leader David</a> — has been presumed missing, leading <a href=#>her to file a missing person report in 2013</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“The Los Angeles Police Department has already stated that the case is closed and that the report filed by Leah Remini was unfounded,” Scientology’s Media Relations team told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in a statement at the time. “Creating this unnecessary burden for law enforcement was even more irresponsible given the entire episode was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Ms. Remini, cooked up with unemployed, anti-religious zealots who blog on the fringe of the Internet. Sadly, rather than move on with her life and career, Ms. Remini has aligned herself with a handful of untrustworthy, lunatic tabloid sources who obsessively harass the Church to advance their selfish agendas.”</p><p class=p1>Cruise’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Maverick&nbsp;</i>filmmaker</a>, <strong>Joseph Kosinski</strong>, was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film at Saturday’s ceremony, but he ultimately lost to&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>’s<strong> Daniel Kwan</strong> and </a><strong><a href=#>Daniel Scheinert</a><i>.</i></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJugmV2WxKK%2Bw6xka2hiaHqrwcOdZJqokam8uHnSoZidnaNiwbC5jJyprqGjmnq0r8iepa2nnKS0uns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
