So, where was the Manson ranch? The family set their headquarters at the Spahn Ranch in the late 1960s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/381645f1cbb73ff6.jpg><h2>How did Manson get Spahn Ranch?</h2><p class=align-left>Before the Manson family found shelter in the Spahn Ranch, they lived in Dennis Wilson's cabin of the Beach Boys fame. The convicted murderer and cult leader alongside his followers were evicted from the property in August 1968. Nevertheless, the Manson clan relocated to the Los Angeles County ranch after some members of the family made an acquaintance with the property owner, George Spahn.</p><p class=align-left>When the Mansons <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">arrived at the ranch</a> in 1968, George Spahn was nearly 80 years old. He was lonely and almost a blind man who needed companionship. Spahn allowed the Mansons to live on his ranch in return for companionship and labour.</p><h2>Spahn Ranch tour</h2><p class=align-left>The property has become a tourist centre that many people want to visit today because of what it stands for. Over the years, several people have taken a tour through the place. To reach the place, take 118 west and exit the Santa Susanna Pass. Once you get to the exit, cross the bridge and then turn left. Afterwards, drive down the road around until you see the church located at the Rocky Peak on top of the hill on the left. A few of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">comments from people</a> who visited the place are these:</p>I wonder how many people drive by this spot every day and have no idea what they are passing. It's just weird how Spahn Ranch went from Ground Zero to some of California's most infamous murder cases to an overgrown patch of weeds a few decades later. - Kim D.Cool place still there. Lots of rumors fire dept blew it up and locals hate you and keep you out all this nonsense. ill spill the beans its on Kheuner and 118 there is a bike shop and a old bar at the end of the street the hill behind the bike shop is the cave. its easy to get to super trippy place. - Colby G.<h2>Spahn Ranch now pictures</h2><p class=align-left>Apart from the fact that the property is known as the primary residence of Charles Manson, notable movies that were shot in the location are also part of the reasons why the place is famous. However, since the fire encounter, it is no longer the same again. These are some of the pictures of what the place looks like today.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Desolate and empty</strong></p><p class=align-left>Most of the things that are found in the ranch today are old and dilapidated buildings. Besides, it is filled with lots of rubbles and overgrown bushes. It is almost hard to believe that the once deadly zone is now a place anyone can visit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/82423b417025772f.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>Eventful locations</strong></p><p class=align-left>Even though the venue is no longer what it used to be, there are lots of notable locations on the property that are worth seeing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/c98390da0f72713a.jpg><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><p class=align-left>There are lots of interesting questions that have been raised over time concerning the activities on the property and its owner.
