A charge to keep you had, and you fulfilled it! I will value myself more and walk closer to God, I will hug my wife tighter everyday and NEVER let a day go by without telling her I love her! I will cherish my children in their glory and misfortunes! Thank you for being an example to us all. Thanks for letting me borrow Kenneth Watts on those early morning bike rides. You will truly be missed here in the physical, but I celebrate you in the spiritual now that you are with the Father!
