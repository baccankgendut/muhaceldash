I wasn’t OK, and I didn’t know how to talk about that with anyone,” Page said, adding that the studio told him to wear a dress to the movie’s Toronto Film Festival premiere.</p><p>“I said I wanted to wear a suit, and Fox Searchlight was basically like, ‘No, you need to wear a dress.’ And they took me in a big rush to one of those fancy stores on Bloor Street [in Toronto]. They had me wear a dress, and … that was that. And then all the <i>Juno</i> press, all the photo shoots – Michael Cera was in slacks and sneakers.”</p><p>The actor called the incident “really extremely, extremely f***ed up”.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if I’m trans or cis. Lots of cis women dress how I dress. That has nothing to f***ing do with it,” Page wrote.</p><p>“I get that people don’t understand. Oh, f**k you, you’re famous, and you have money, and you had to wear a dress, boo-hoo. I don’t not understand that reaction. But that’s mixed with: I wish people would understand that that sh*t literally did almost kill me.”</p><p>In a 2021 interview for <i><a class=body-link href=# title=time.com>Time</a></i> – Page’s first since disclosing he was trans – the actor said he “never recognised” himself on the red carpet previously.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Even though [I was] an actor, just putting on a T-shirt cut for a woman would make me so unwell,” he said, adding that feminine clothing felt like a “costume”.</p><p>Since then, Page has made his Met Gala debut in a sharp Balenciaga suit and hit the 2022 Oscars in a Gucci tux, the latter of which he described as a moment of “trans joy”.</p><p><i>This story originally appeared on <a class=body-link href=#>Page Six</a> and is republished here with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ian6S4tHnMmp6aspmjsrR7zJqemrKZo7K0e8Slo6KnpGK9orPEZqeoq5WoerS0yKurpZ2jqHqnu9FmnKyppZ6%2FpnnMmp6aspmjsnC6xLCqZqukpL%2B6e49tnJpqlpawc62XcZ1xaJRsg6SxkHJqcHFpl32mssNw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
