People forget how much you use your stomach for everyday things, even getting out of bed is impossible when you just have surgery because you just use your tummy muscles all the time. So let people look after you for a bit and just take your time to recover because everyone's different.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09a90a53ab57-mollie-pearce-mirror.jpg><p id=eKqr8sbYO5u data-wc=109>Speaking about her own experience with surgery, she continued: <strong>“</strong>Before the surgery, I struggled to come to terms with the fact that I was going to have a bag for the rest of my life. But I’ve been given a taste of life. I would rather have this bag stuck to me forever than go back to how I was living before… We look at it as something disgusting, you have this negative opinion - I did anyway. I want to change that. I want to make people realise that it can have such a positive effect. It’s not a last resort or the worst thing in the world.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/56d6c741cce6-kate-middleton.jpg><p id=eY2eXTdIuhY8 data-wc=40>Kate underwent an operation on 16 January, and the palace released a statement updating well-wishers on her recovery which read: “The Princess of Wales has returned home to Windsor to continue her recovery from surgery.
