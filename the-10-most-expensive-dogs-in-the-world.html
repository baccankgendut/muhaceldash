They are loyal companions and if you've been lucky enough to love a dog in your life, well, you know how great it is! During the stay-at-home orders associated with the coronavirus pandemic, many families are turning to local shelters to foster (and possibly adopt) new four-legged friends for their families. Having a pet is a big responsibility from food and exercise and socialization to vet bills and grooming appointments – it can be a big financial commitment too. Make sure you're ready for all aspects of being a dog owner before you go out and adopt or buy a dog. While there are plenty of dog breeders out there that can sell you your dream pup – there are also a ton of truly amazing dogs that can be found for much less (if not free sometimes!) at your local shelter. You don't have to buy an expensive dog. Your garden variety Heinz 57-style mutt can be the best dog you've ever had! #AdoptDontShop! That said, buying a puppy from a breeder calls for a lot of research into how safe and healthy the dogs are. Most breeders are reputable and will maintain a relationship with the families of the puppies they adopt out for the life of a dog. Just like some breeds are more popular than others (we're looking at you, beloved Labrador Retriever), some are much more expensive than others for a variety of reasons that range from difficulty birthing puppies to being rare. Let's take a look at the 10 most expensive dogs in the world. Woof! Woof!</p><p>#<strong>10.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Afghan Hound – $7,000</strong></p><p>The Afghan Hound is early recognizable due to its thick, silky smooth hair.
