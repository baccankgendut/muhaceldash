Lifetime’s “Big Driver” now joins “Misery,” “The Shining” and “Secret Window” in the Stephen King collection of stories about authors going bonkers.
Here, Maria Bello’s successful crime novelist Tess Thorne has a particularly awful reason to become unhinged: she’s been brutally assaulted and left for dead. (This is not a spoiler; it’s the movie’s opening shot.)
Flashing back, we see Tess driving to a reading; her series of books about a group of mystery-solving elderly women is highly popular, and in this small Massachusetts town, Ramona (Ann Dowd) is both the head of her fan base and an expert on local shortcuts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
