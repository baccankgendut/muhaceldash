Nahmad is letting go of Nature Morte, a 1921 Picasso oil-on-canvas painting that Nahmad says he doesn't specifically remember his rationale in buying:"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The cause? Clean, drinkable water for underserved residents of Cameroon, Madagascar, and Morocco. But Nahmad himself isn't giving the painting away – instead, the raffle organizers decided to buy it from him as a way to encourage other art collectors to agree to similar arrangements. As Reille explained:</p><p><strong>"David first said, 'I don't think I have a painting for a million euros. I have really beautiful paintings that are worth much more than that. But you know what? Let's go together to my book, my collection book, and we'll try to find something together.'</strong></p><p><strong>"For a million euros, usually you can get a nice drawing, a water color, a beautiful print. But it's extremely rare to find a painting, and we did find this one in the end."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295218 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-173342867.jpg alt width=900 height=617 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295218 class=wp-caption-text>VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images</p><p>Nahmad has been collecting Picasso going all the way back to the 1960s along with his brother (pictured above), when he says Picasso paintings could be bought for as little as $5,000. Now, his collection of art from Picasso as well as myriad other artists is valued at an estimated $3 billion. And one lucky raffle winner will soon own a (very) small piece of that collection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfl7atuMiopZqhopp6uLXToWSlmaKcsrTAjKmpoq6RqbJur86lo56bpJ68r3nOn2SpmZKhvG68yJyYrKufYr2itc2toKefo2KwsLrSopueqqNirm6%2FwKWcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
