The Lord tells us where we are going and tells us when we are coming. So I’m not overly upset about it, and he knows how much each one of us can bear, and he calls us home with those things in mind. That’s the way I feel about it, because he loves us like that.”</p><p>Franklin, an 18-time Grammy winner, died of advanced pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type, her longtime publicist said in a statement. She died surrounded by family and loved ones at home in Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>“I miss her, but I didn’t want her to suffer,” Knight told Us. “I really didn’t. And, you know, people could see it. She just kept driving and driving, and she knew it was a disease that would take her out, and she just kept on doing what she does best. So Aretha, safe journey.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Franklin was honored with <a href=#>an open-casket visitation</a> at the Charles H.
