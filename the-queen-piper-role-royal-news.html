While at Windsor, Balmoral and Holyroodhouse, the Piper also pipes at the dinner table. However, he doesn't accompany Her Majesty during her time at Sandringham, due to the lack of accommodation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cac2ce08a9bd-queen-elizabeth-piper-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ew7F2b9vY8ax data-wc=9><strong>The monarchy has had an official piper since 1843</strong></p><p id=eoCVZngEYzhS data-wc=152>The role was created by Queen Victoria after she discovered the Marquess of Breadalbane has her own piper. In a letter to her mother about the position, she wrote: "We have heard nothing but bagpipes since we have been in the beautiful Highlands and I have become so fond of it that I mean to have a Piper, who can if you like it, pipe every night at Frogmore." Speaking about playing for the Queen to , Gordon Webster, who was the Piper to the Sovereign in mid to late 1990s, said the experience was: "Fantastic. Just the ultimate piping job in the world." Opening up about the particulars of the role, he continued: "Because the Queen didn't like that you repeated tunes every other day, so I probably had about 700 or 800 tunes under my belt and they're all [in my head] because as a bagpiper you don't use music."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eVZVR0U5Bg2J data-wc=54>Gordon happened to be the Queen's piper during a very difficult time for the royal family – the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. Speaking about that time, he said: "Actually, William and Harry tried these bagpipes that night, then I went back to Balmoral Castle and we heard the bad news."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
