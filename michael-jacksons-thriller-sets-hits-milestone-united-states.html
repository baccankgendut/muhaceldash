With a career that spanned decades and spawned some of the most memorable songs of our time, the music of the "King of Pop" continues to touch millions, despite the fact that he has been gone for over a half-decade. As a result of his worldwide popularity, his music continues to sell at a rapid rate. That brings us to the sales record that Jackson's most popular album set earlier this week.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Michael Jackson's 1982 album,&nbsp;<i>Thriller,</i>&nbsp;is the greatest selling album of all time, with over 100 million total copies sold worldwide. Despite the fact that it is very short relative to the standard album length&nbsp;(only nine tracks), it features some of Jackson's most popular hits, such as "Thriller," "Beat It," and "Billie Jean." It has set records across the board in the music industry, including grabbing eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of The Year.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And now, <i>Thriller </i>has set yet another record. The album has become the first album to be certified <strong>30 times platinum</strong> (30 million sold units) in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America, per an announcement by Jackson's estate.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-179700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mj.jpg alt="Phil Walter/Getty Images" width=900 height=647 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-179700 class=wp-caption-text>Phil Walter/Getty Images</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When speaking about <i>Thriller's </i>popularity, RIAA chairman and CEO Cary Sherman said:</span></p><p class=p1 style=padding-left:30px><span class=s1>"He didn't want to sell records to blacks or whites or Americans… He wanted to sell records to everyone, Africa, Asia, everywhere. It's just continued to sell and sell."

Not these days."</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It is worth noting that <a href=#>Adele's</a> <i>21 </i>has sold 11 million copies in the U.S. since 2011.
