The 41-year-old singer opted to share an old pic where he and his lovely mom who looked like him stood side by side and directly smiled at the camera. Captioning his post, Tevin wrote,</p><p class=dh>“#happybirthdaymama Happy BD to this pretty lady, my mama @waxahachie72. Love ya mom!!!”</p><p class=dh>Tevin made a surprising revelation decades ago when he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/tevin-campbell-admitted-hes-try-sexual-where-has-he-been/2/>admitted</a> he wasn’t gay but was “trying a lot of things.” He said he wasn’t exclusively attracted to men but when asked if he was bisexual, he said no. Instead, he coined the term ‘TRY-sexual’ to describe himself and his sexual activities.</p><p class=dh>“I’m trying a lot of things. Being open-minded. It has nothing to do with attraction. It’s just having fun, and I did a lot of that on the road with dancers.”</p><p class=dh>Since his telling interview, Tevin laid low from the limelight, appearing in Broadway and making sporadic performances. But in February, the singer surfaced along with another controversial issue thrown his way. Following Quincy Jones’s <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/quincy-jones-in-conversation.html>Vulture interview</a> where he described Tevin as an “underrated” musician, rumors circulated that the legendary music producer had molested the ‘Can We Talk?’ singer when he was still a minor.</p><p class=dh>Responding to the rumors, Tevin took to Twitter and laughed it off.</p><p class=dh>“Now Im trending folks will really say some disgusting things. Tevin was molested by Quincy’…GTFOH wit the devil.”</p><p class=dh>He added a series of laughing emojis to highlight the hilarity of the rumor.</p><p class=dh>Later, he also tweeted a quote from Quincy,</p><p class=dh>“God is pushing the bad in our face to make us fight back.”</p><p class=dh>Sexuality and molestation rumors aside, Tevin has made a mark in the industry through his distinct voice. His platinum-selling debut album ‘T.E.V.I.N.’ in 1991 earned him a number six spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 for the track ‘Tell Me What You Want Me to Do.’ His second album ‘I’m Ready’ in 1993 went double-Platinum, carrying two of his most popular songs, ‘Can We Talk’ and ‘I’m Ready.’</p><p class=dh>Kevin also tried his skills in acting appearing in the film ‘Graffiti Bridge’ and in television shows ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’ and ‘Moesha.’ His tenor voice gave life to the character Powerline in Disney’s ‘A Goofy Movie’, and he was also cast in Broadway in the musical Hairspray in 2005.</p><p class=dh>Throughout his career, Tevin earned 5 Grammy nominations and sold over 3 million copies worldwide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJobWplYsGmwsinZJyZnaWvprjLZqqhmaKasW6%2BwKucZqiZmHquu8xmqZ6ulZZ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
