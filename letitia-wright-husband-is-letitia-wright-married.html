John Boyega and Letitia Wright have been romantically involved, according to reports.</p><p>However, the Actress and the Actor later clarified that they were just close friends. John Boyega is an Actor and producer from Britain. His portrayal as Moses in the sci-fi comedy Attack the Block in 2011 propelled him to fame in his native Britain. His breakout role as Finn in the Star Wars sequel trilogy films The Force Awakens & The Rise of Skywalker gave him international recognition in 2019.</p><p>According to the online reports, Wright is currently single.
