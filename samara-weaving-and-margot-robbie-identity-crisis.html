However, her visage is very similar to that of another Hollywood star: Margot Robbie.

Since Margot’s meteoric rise to global fame has no clear explanation, she is frequently mistaken for Hugo Weaving, who is also a famous actor and actress."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What’s the deal with their family?</p><h2><span id=It8217s_About_That_Time_Samara_Weaving_Dated_Margot_Robbie>It’s About That Time Samara Weaving Dated Margot Robbie</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> It’s About That Time Samara Weaving Dated Margot Robbie</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Are You and Your Twin Now Best Buds?</a></li></ul><p>Like many famous Australian actresses, Margot is a native of Australia. Both women look like sisters, although they are not related. This is because there is a great deal of confounding between the two due to the obvious similarity in their facial structures.</p><p>The two are often mistaken for one another, and even though there are speculations that they might not be friends, we are delighted to report that they are.</p><p>Very close companions, indeed. Several admirers have approached Weaving, assuming she is the ‘Suicide Squad actress Margot Robbie, who she frequently gets confused with.</p><p>Since they both speak with the same accent, Samara’s standard response is always, “No, that’s not who you think it is.”That’s because, as she puts it, “I just stand there as Margot does and people think she’s being incredibly harsh.”</p><p>The actress appears to have genuine feelings for Margot. One could assume that Samara feels threatened by the comparison since she has made such a name for herself in the profession for so long.</p><p>However, appearances suggest otherwise. When asked if she ever gets fed up with all the parallels, that was her response. These two incredible people share a striking resemblance in appearance but have led quite different lives and pursued very different occupations.</p><p>Because they appear to be relatively good friends and have shared the screen before, neither of them seems to be bothered by the parallels.</p><h2><span id=Are_You_and_Your_Twin_Now_Best_Buds>Are You and Your Twin Now Best Buds?</span></h2><p>Celebrating her 31st birthday in 2021, Margot Robbie had a Love Island-themed bash for her guests. Kelly Grace and Samara Weaving were just two of the celebrities in attendance.</p><p>As proof of their friendship, Samara attended her small birthday celebration. The party looked like it was a blast, and I’m sure the two actors who look so much alike now had a blast spending time together for the first time.</p><p>Samara became a member of the cast of “Babylon,” which also included Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. This lavish period drama film is scheduled for release in 2022, and there is a lot of excitement about it.</p><p>We agree with many others who think it would be awesome if the two women worked together.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>John Travolta’s Brutal Post-Plastic Surgery Appearance Stuns Fans</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>George Clooney’s Ethnicity: What Is It?</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfqK6urdGaZLCdkau2r7OMmqWdZZ2Wv6i702apqJqSnrJutcOepa2hpK56pL7IrKCsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
