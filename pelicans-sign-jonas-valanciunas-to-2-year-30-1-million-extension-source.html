He has averaged a double-double in each of the past two seasons.</p><p>He will make $14.7 million in 2022-23 after his new extension. As of now, he would be No. 11 for highest salaries among centers next season, behind Adams ($17.9 million) and ahead of the Magic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Wendell Carter Jr.</a></p><p>A lottery pick by the <a href=# rel=noopener>Toronto Raptors</a> in 2011, Valanciunas has started at least 57 games in eight of nine NBA seasons. The Pelicans begin the season Wednesday against the <a href=# rel=noopener>Philadelphia 76ers</a>.</p><p>(Photo: Chris Gardner / Getty Images)</p><h2>Why the Pels needed to lock down Valanciunas</h2><p>William Guillory, Pelicans beat writer: After their long-shot attempts at signing <a href=# rel=noopener>Kyle Lowry</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Paul</a> last summer in free agency, the Pelicans probably learned a tough lesson about the obstacles of getting established players to come to New Orleans without proof this team is ready to win.</p><p>With Valanciunas set to hit unrestricted free agency next summer, the Pels avoided a potential standoff with him that would've cost them much more than the $30.1 million price tag they got him for today. He's also a highly skilled big who can score and rebound at a high rate.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>How important is he to New Orleans' success moving forward?</h2><p>Guillory: As <a href=# rel=noopener>Zion Williamson</a> continues his <a href=# rel=noopener>recovery from offseason foot surgery</a>, Valanciunas will be the biggest threat in the paint for the <a href=# rel=noopener>first few weeks of the season</a> and a crucial cog in first-year coach Willie Green's new offense.</p><p>Even though the Pels haven't seen what Valanciunas and Zion look like on the court together just yet, it's fair to say these two will dominate smaller teams around the basket. Having a center with great hands and finishing ability in the paint will make life much easier for Zion, and much different than what he had last year in Adams.</p><p>Defense will certainly be a question with these two, but they should be a great fit together on the other end.</p><h2>What to expect from him this season?</h2><p>Guillory: Valanciunas is coming off the best season of his career last year in Memphis and he's stepping into a situation in New Orleans where they'll need him to be just as productive until Zion is back in the lineup. He won't have a pick-and-roll partner quite like <a href=# rel=noopener>Ja Morant</a> in New Orleans, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Brandon Ingram</a> is highly efficient in those situations and Green will lean heavily on the Ingram-Valanciunas two-man game late in fourth quarters.</p><p>I'd expect Valanciunas to put up big numbers until Zion comes back, but, again, the defense will be a major concern.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2pwbWhlbnxzfJFqZmpoX2d9cLzEpaCcmZ6oerS1xqdko6eelsBuwsClmKebmaq7or%2BMraZmal2usqK%2BjGxnZmldoratuMiopWadqKmyr7%2FIqKVmq5%2Bqv6Sxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
