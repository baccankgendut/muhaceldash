For starters, Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali) will share some steamy moments with shirtless Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez), but it looks like theyâ€™ll return to the topic of Ace Cassadine (Jay and Joey Clay) eventually."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The show will be preempted for sports coverage on Friday, November 24, so fans will have to wait until Monday to see whatâ€™s next in Port Charles.</p><p>For starters, Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali) will share some steamy moments with shirtless Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez), but it looks like theyâ€™ll return to the topic of Ace Cassadine (Jay and Joey Clay) eventually.</p><p>Trina will remind Spencer that he canâ€™t always get what he wants as she continues to help him cope with all the changes happening.</p><p>Spencer is trying to learn how to pull back from Ace and be a big brother instead of a father figure, but letting go will be an adjustment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marshall Ashford (Robert Gossett) will voice concerns when Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) updates his dad on the investigation he intends to carry out with Jordan Ashford (Tanisha Harper).</p><p>It may seem too risky to Marshall, but Curtis will feel the need to go after justice and give himself a sense of purpose.</p><p>As for Stella Henry (Vernee Watson) and Portia Robinson (Brook Kerr), it looks like theyâ€™ll hear the news about Curtis and Jordanâ€™s team effort as well.</p><p>It could leave Portia worried about Curtisâ€™ safety and about the potential of him reconnecting on a deeper level with Jordan.</p><p>At the Metro Court restaurant, Emma Scorpio-Drake (Brooklyn Rae Silzer) will catch Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy) and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) off guard with a question about how long theyâ€™ve been dating.</p><p>Robert will choke on his beverage and get rather flustered, so Diane may have to intervene and suggest theyâ€™re still trying to figure out how to navigate things.</p><p>At the Quartermaine mansion, Lois Cerullo (Rena Sofer) will push for answers about what Gloria Cerullo (Ellen Travolta) did. Gloria is clearly in some trouble and has been avoiding phone calls from Uncle Pete, so sheâ€™ll make a confession to Lois sooner or later.</p><p>Over with Nina Corinthos (Cynthia Watros), sheâ€™ll try to do damage control since she helped Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) cover up Charlotte Cassadineâ€™s (Scarlett Fernandez) actions by deleting the security footage.</p><p>Nina will explain her perspective and insist she was only trying to do what was best for Charlotte, but Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) will ask if she thinks Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) will see it that way.</p><p>Although Sonny will pick up on the tension between them, Anna may decide not to rat Nina out to her husband.</p><p>Next on Mondayâ€™s GH episode, Carly Spencer (Laura Wright) will surprise Sonny by going along with a suggestion Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) made, so that could lead to some bonding moments for these exes.</p><p>Finally, Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) will dredge up the past again when it comes to Nina, so Willow Corinthos (Katelyn MacMullen) will angrily ask why heâ€™s so intent on rekindling bad memories.</p><p>Willow will feel like itâ€™s time for Michael to let go of his resentment and try to play nice, but heâ€™ll struggle to do that since he knows Nina sent the SEC after Carly and Drew Cain (Cameron Mathison).</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Michael will have to figure out how to resolve this conflict without alerting Willow to the heartbreaking truth, so stay tuned.</p><p>CDLâ€™s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your favorite GH hotspot.</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Weâ€™re taking today off, but Thanksgiving continues in Port Charles on Monday! ðŸ¦ƒ Did Gloria jinx Loisâ€™ attempt at breaking the Quartermaine curse?
