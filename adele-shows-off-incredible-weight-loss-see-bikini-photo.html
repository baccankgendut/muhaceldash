Excess weight puts additional stress on your body, including your heart and other organs, vasculature, as well as your joints. Many people choose to lose weight to improve joint pain that causes daily discomfort which severely affects quality of life.”</p><p>Adele’s former pilates instructor <a href=#>Camila Goodis also gave Us insight into her lifestyle change in January.</a></p><p>“I think she did change her lifestyle, like eating better, exercising moderately,” Goodis, who trained with Adele after she welcomed son Angelo, now 7, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Simon Konecki</strong></a>, told Us. “I tell all my clients, ‘You can exercise 10 hours a day, if your diet is poor, you’re not going to see success.’ That’s the real truth.”</p><p>While Adele has yet to open up about her weight loss journey, fans have praised her in the comments section of her Instagram.
