He grew up in Plano City, Texas, with an elder brother and a twin sister. Crusius attended Beverly Elementary School in Plano, where he had a school friend named Daniel Heo. However, as he got older, Crusius became increasingly radicalized, leading to his involvement in the tragic shooting at Walmart. The attack targeted Hispanic shoppers, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. Crusius was arrested, pleaded guilty to hate crime charges, and received 90 consecutive life sentences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patricks_Educational_Background></span>Patrick’s Educational Background:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Patrick Crusius began his educational journey at Beverly Elementary School in Plano, where he formed a friendship with Daniel Heo, engaging in sports activities such as school and basketball during their free time. Later on, Crusius continued his education at Liberty High School. However, he ultimately completed his graduation from Plano Senior High School.</p><p>Following his high school education, Crusius pursued his Bachelor’s degree at Collin College in McKinney, Texas. Although his time at college was cut short as he dropped out after two years, his enrollment at Collin College marked his academic pursuit beyond high school.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patrick_Crusius_Walmart_Shooter_Convicted></span>Patrick Crusius: Walmart Shooter Convicted<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On the afternoon of August 3, 2019, a tragic event unfolded at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, United States, when an individual or group opened fire.
