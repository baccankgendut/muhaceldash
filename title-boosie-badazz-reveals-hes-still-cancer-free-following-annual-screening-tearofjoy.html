He followed up with the good news on Twitter, writing, “IM CANCER&nbsp;FREE. #tearofjoy Thanks to everybody said a prayer for me #GODISGREAT.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>IM CANCER ♋️ FREE <a href=#>#tearofjoy</a> Thanks to everybody said a prayer for me <a href=#>#GODISGREAT</a></p><p>— Boosie BadAzz (@BOOSIEOFFICIAL) <a href=#>March 17, 2021</a></p><p>Boosie — who also has diabetes — was given the devastating diagnosis in November 2015 and quickly underwent a nephrectomy to remove the cancer. TMZ revealed he didn’t have health insurance so he wound up paying $90,000 for the procedure, which he’d presumably do again if it meant <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>saving his life.</a> Boosie thanked everyone for their support prior to procedure.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“To all my family, fans n supporters I really appreciate the love n concern that’s been giving to me since I was diagnosed with kidney cancer,” he wrote at the time. “I go n for surgery n I need prayers for a great surgery n rehabilitation.”</p><p>During Boosie’s health struggles, he also had to face accusations of <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>making up the illness.&nbsp;</a>In 2016, he shared a photo of his surgical scar to his Instagram account and wrote in the caption, “I’m tired of these stupid muthafuckas saying I ain’t have cancer sending me DMs asking why am I lying saying I had cancer. who wants to fake or lie about something like that not me, not a real one [100] [100] wtf u mad cause I asked for prayers n gottem.
