The Worldwide Leader in Sports is already setting its sights on its next target: former Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos quarterback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peyton Manning</a>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Per Front Office Sports' Michael McCarthy, ESPN is prepared to offer Manning a contract worth $18 million to $20 million per year.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tony Romo could have a short-lived reign as the highest-paid TV sports analyst. ESPN is prepared to offer Peyton Manning $18 million to $20 million a year to call 'Monday Night Football,' said sources. Romo will make $17 million a year under new CBS deal.<a href=#>https://t.co/OubhKCGuao</a></p><p>— Michael McCarthy (@MMcCarthyREV) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Manning would serve as an analyst for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Monday Night Football</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. And while nothing official has been announced yet, the move would likely come in tandem with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MNF </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>moving back to ABC. By having a national audience, Disney/ABC/ESPN would get even more exposure. Manning is recognizable enough that he would appeal to casual fans.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, as they did with Romo, critics will ask if such a hefty price tag is worth it for any player. Manning made $19.2 million his last season in the NFL, when he won a Super Bowl with the Broncos. He could make more than that in his first year as an analyst.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Then again, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Monday Night Football </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>doesn't have the star power that some of the other broadcasts do. Perhaps a splash like Manning would be valuable enough.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For now, it looks like Manning is in the driver's seat as far as a decision goes. As is his M.O., he'll likely take his time. After all, there's still plenty of offseason left.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294938 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-813492344.jpg alt width=900 height=645 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294938 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjp2YsqtdlrO1sdFmmpurXZyut7GMraansV2nvK67jJpkq52TpL%2BlecKopa2qkZjBbrHSqaVmoaNivbOxz5qpnpxdqbxuwM6pZKKsXay2tbSMqZyyrJ%2Bjeq6tzaegp59f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
