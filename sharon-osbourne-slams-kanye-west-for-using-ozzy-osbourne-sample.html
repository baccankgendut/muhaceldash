West then appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored to apologize for his remarks. Two months later, West sat down with <strong>Alex Jones</strong> where he stated he saw “<a href=#>good things about Hitler</a>.”</p><p>Most recently, West went on a rant in December 2023 where he claimed that “Zionists” control private schools and hospitals, adding that “it’s 60 million of us in America, 60 million Jews in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days later, West took to social media to <a href=#>apologize again</a> with a message written in Hebrew.</p><p>“I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any ‘unintended outburst’ caused by my words or actions,’” he said at the time. “[It] was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.
