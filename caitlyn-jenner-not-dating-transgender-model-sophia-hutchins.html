She told her Malibu-based school’s newspaper, <a href=#>Pepperdine Graphic</a>, in December 2016 that the E! personality’s own transition “made it so much more real for [me], like normal and successful people do this and people are OK when they do it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenner transitioned from male to female in mid-2015 and underwent gender confirmation surgery in January. Since then, the former Olympian — who was previously married to interior designer <strong>Chrystie Crownover</strong>, actress <strong>Linda Thompson</strong> and most recently reality star <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, has stated that she isn’t in a rush to find love again.</p><p>“I never have [dated a man],” she said on her former E! docuseries, I Am Cait, in March 2016. “To be honest with you, I can’t see myself dating women in the future. I’ve been there, done that. I have three very strong ex-wives. I just don’t see it. I don’t see a woman being attracted to me. If there was a female in my life, it would be more like a friendship than it would be a serious relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qvu9Nmm5qsmaO0bsDRmqWsn5Wjsaa%2BjKamnZ2cYsCwvMeimGagpamwqbXNrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
