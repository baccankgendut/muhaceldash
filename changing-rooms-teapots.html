However, things didn’t go to plan when the teapots broke since the shelf couldn’t hold the weight of the books.</p><p>You can relive the epic disaster scene from the YouTube video below.</p><p></p><h3>Fans react to the teapots scene</h3><p>As soon as fans heard about the renewal of the show, many took to Twitter to share clips and images from the teapots scene.</p><p>One fan <a href=#>tweeted</a>: “I can’t stop thinking about the smashed teapots and collapsed shelving on Changing Rooms.”</p><p>“Omg. The poor teapots,” someone else <a href=#>reacted</a>. “They did not deserve this. The people consented to Changing Rooms, tue teapots did not.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just been reminded of that time Linda Barker destroyed a woman’s collection of antique teapots on Changing Rooms by installing a hanging shelf made of what looks like string & sticky tape & loading it with books & today just got better x 10.
