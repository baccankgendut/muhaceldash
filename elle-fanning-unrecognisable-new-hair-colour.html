Her large eyes were perfected with a bold wing using liquid eyeliner, which contrasted beautifully with a dusty pink eyeshadow on the lids of her eyes. A bold brow, rose-hued blusher and a semi-sheer gloss completed her stunning make-up look.</p><p id=efWK2RQMSqm data-wc=41>This isn’t the first time Elle has changed her hair colour. Last summer, she debuted candy floss pink hair on social media, sharing a striking close-up photo of her new rose-tinted locks, which were worn down in a sleek blow-dry style.</p><p id=eRYSUy27xmBJ data-wc=9><strong>The 19-year-old actress experimented with pink hair last summer</strong></p><p id=e5FnxoB5bEKz data-wc=59>The Maleficent star also showed off her beauty credentials by rocking a matte pink lipstick that closely matched her new hair colour, and wore a white long-sleeved top to contrast the bold shade. "Dusty [rose emoji] hair: @justjenda," she simply captioned the snap, revealing that she had turned to celebrity hair colourist Jenda Alcorn to help create the look.</p><p id=eZizvdjFs0Ve data-wc=25>Back in 2012, meanwhile, Elle, then 13, memorably showcased a lovely auburn hair colour while portraying protagonist Ginger in the coming-of-age drama Ginger & Rosa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9lmlva2pkZoVyhI6eo6WdXZuur7rIp55mrZ6nsqS7xqegrJmSobJuusSwZKGZmad6pLvLqKyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
