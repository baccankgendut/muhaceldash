He is probably the guy I’m looking forward to watching the most. I don’t know what to expect, but heard good things.”</p><p>When asked about the growing relationship with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Sabin said he thinks it’s great and that TNA should work with as many companies as possible.</p><p>“I think it’s great. We should work with as many companies as possible,” Chris Sabin said. “Working with New Japan has been great because it brings a certain level of coolness to TNA. Especially, a casual fan. New Japan has had such a strong reputation since 1972 when they started. They have a high level of wrestling.</p><p>“I think their best can rub off on our guys. There are guys on the TNA roster who haven’t gone to Japan a lot and haven’t competed in that style. So if they bring a guy from Japan over and wrestle against them, maybe they can learn a few things. And see a new perspective on what pro wrestling can be. I think it’s better for everyone.”</p><p>When asked about TNA’s big signing for Hard to Kill that Scott D’Amore teased last month, Sabin admitted he had no clue who it was going to be but jokingly hoped for John Cena or The Rock.</p><p>“Who do I want it to be? I would say I would want it to be The Rock or John Cena, right? But as far as who it could be, I’m not sure. I have no idea,” Chris Sabin admitted. “There are a couple of guesses I can put out there, but I don’t want to put a guess out there and be right. So I’ll say I think it’s John Cena and The Rock and know it’s not.”</p><p><a href=#>Chris Sabin vs. KUSHIDA vs. Vikingo Set For TNA Hard To Kill</a></p><p>What do you make of Chris Sabin’s comments?
