The house, which is considered modest by Hollywood standards, is in keeping with the actor's spartan approach to life. He is well-known for the fact that he has never owned a property and prefers to stay in hotels wherever he is shooting or touring with his band Dogstar.</p><p id=eFVDoD5rarH data-wc=21>During filming of his 2000 film, <i>The Replacements,</i> he even turned down a luxury trailer the studio had provided for him.</p><p id=ezhHj555_YqH data-wc=62>"I like to keep things simple," he said. "I spoke to the producers and they took the big trailer away and gave me one the same size as those of the other actors... I don't need a lot of space or comfort. Just give me a couch, a table, a few bottles of mineral water, and some fruit, and I'll be fine."</p><p id=eOitljb3Tey><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/film/2003/05/29/keanureeves/imgs/keanu-dop1a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=e9R0FxIZKG data-wc=3>Photo: © Alphapress.com</p><p id=eHcd5bbe8M data-wc=20>After years spent living in hotels and trailers on location, the Matrix star has splashed out on a multi-million-dollar estate</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
