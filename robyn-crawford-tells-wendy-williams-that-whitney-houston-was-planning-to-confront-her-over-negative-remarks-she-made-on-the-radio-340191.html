Crawford also revealed during her interview that Houston was not a fan of Williams, and she was planning to confront her over negative comments she was making on her radio show.</p><p>During the conversation, Williams told Crawford about how the radio station she was working for at the time paid for her to fly over Houston and Brown’s wedding in a helicopter. And, she also admitted that she didn’t know Houston at all, and only talked to her once for an infamous radio interview.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4vc7LDhL9R/</p><p>Crawford responded by saying that she heard that interview, and it took place when Houston was completely fed up with Williams over the things she had been saying about her and Crawford on the radio over the course of many years.</p><p>Williams defended herself by saying that’s what she does, and everything she was saying turned out to be true. Crawford seemed to have an issue with Williams talking about Houston like they were good friends, when the reality was she didn’t know the singer at all.</p><p>Crawford explained that Williams would talk on the radio like she was Houston’s roommate, and when they would listen to the show in the car, Houston would ask: “Who is this woman?”</p><p>“We didn’t know what you looked like,” said Crawford. “And our plan was to go down to Hudson Street…and wait for you.”</p><p>“You were gonna jump me?” asked Williams.</p><p>The talk show host added that she can’t fight, and she would have ran. And, Crawford explained that they didn’t want to fight, they just wanted to see Williams face-to-face and “have a chat.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4xmROlhWVt/</p><p>“I’m frightened,” said Williams. “I dodged that bullet.”</p><p>Crawford also talked about her book, which tells the story about how she met Houston when they were teenagers, and it also explores the evolution of their friendship during Houston’s rise to being one of the biggest music superstars on the planet.</p><p>Crawford says that seven years after her best friend’s death, she is now focused on her mental and physical well-being. She currently lives in New Jersey with her wife and children.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Robyn Crawford’s book A Song For You: My Life with Whitney Houston is in bookstores now. And, The Wendy Williams Show airs weekdays in syndication.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2B6uoycqZqvlqS%2FpXnTnqOlq12ssq%2Bw2GauoqScnq6uv4ytn5qsXay1qsDNnrBmoJ%2BqwLW7zWaumqtdpbmius2ipaBlpKR6pLvNn6mopqRitaa%2BjKitnqpdo7KordOirZ5lopq6or7KrGSsoJViuqKwxGamp2WknbJuvsCdoKhlY2l9coWQaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
