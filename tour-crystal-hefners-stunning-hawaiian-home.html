The former model confessed she “needed a change” after <a href=#>living in the Playboy Mansion</a> for 10 years. She told Us that she will open up about her experiences living in the infamous home in her upcoming memoir, <a href=#>Only Say Good Things: Surviving Playboy and Finding Myself</a>, which will drop in 2024.</p><p>“I was in that bubble for a decade,” she tells Us. “Building in Hawaii was a process of finding out what I like and what I want and who I am. It’s been a healing journey.”</p><p>During her search for her <a href=#>dream home</a>, she came across an abandoned 6.5-acre lychee orchard that she saw a lot of potential in. Crystal restored the sprawling orchard and transformed the land into her tropical dream property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Feature-Crystal-Hefner-House-Tour.jpg><p>She partnered with Paradise Tiny Homes, a company that builds small, eco-friendly houses, to create a place that wouldn’t disrupt the beautiful natural surroundings. Crystal decorated the “magical” 290-square-foot home with personal touches like Spanish tile and a mango wood bar- and tabletops. The off-the-grid pad is even eco-friendly, boasting solar panels and a system to collect rainwater.</p><p>“It’s powered by the sun and the water comes from the rain,” she says. “It’s forced me to live minimally and simply.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crystal-Hefner-House-Tour-4.jpg><p>Her home may be simple, but the location can’t be beat. The 6.5 acres feature fruit trees of all sorts, waterfalls, and amazing cliffside views of the ocean — though the best view might be from Crystal’s loft bedroom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crystal-Hefner-House-Tour-3.jpg><p>“The loft features a California King bed and a skylight,” she tells Us. “So you can look up and see the stars at night.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Crystal’s “favorite part” of her abode is the bathroom, which features “all kinds of different ornate tiles.” She also finds her compact kitchen “adorable” and was amazed she managed to fit a dishwasher and washer and dryer into the small space.&nbsp;</p><p>“I get to spend time in Hawaii and travel and hang out with people who have my best interests at heart,” she gushes. “Life is good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp6WneqS%2B2KyrmqRdnbKnusSrqmarpKq7r7XNoGShmaeWtqqtzWafqKWVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
