On January 7, 2023, MPD cops stopped a young guy named <a href=# rel=noopener>Tyre Nichols</a> at a traffic light, but things started going berserk even after the driver’s total cooperation. Preston and his colleagues pulled out their guns at Deandre without any particular reason and started beating him.</p><p>Somehow Tyre escaped, but while he was trying to get away, Hemphill tased him. The scared Nichols could not go far, and little after, law enforcer units captured him, and the torture started.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Statement released Memphis Police Department" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Statement-released-Memphis-Police-Department.jpg alt="Statement released Memphis Police Department" width=400 height=370 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The publicly released video clip revealed that motorist was kicked and punched in the chest, making his condition so bad that even medical attention could not save him.</p><p>Of all the cops that are visible in the bodycam clip, five were fired, and their names were made public, but there were two more officers whose names were kept secret. Finally, on January 30, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sixth officer Hemphill</a> got recognized as one of the two officers. A public notice was also released by the concerned department confirming that it was Preston who tased Nichols.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Preston Hemphill including 5 Memphis Officers who got fired" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Preston-Hemphill-including-5-Memphis-Officers-who-got-fired.jpg alt="Preston Hemphill including 5 Memphis Officers who got fired" width=450 height=343 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Why Preston Hemphill’s Name was Released Soo Late?</strong></h2><p>Peaceful protests are going on around various parts of the country. Everybody wants to know why it took soo long for MPD to reveal the name of Preston, whereas the name of all the African-American officers did not take long to go public.</p><p>Why special treatment to someone who is white? What was the intention behind such an act by the authorities? Is racism deeply embedded in the hierarchy of such a powerful institution? Another question that people are asking is why Hemphill is not facing any charges and only lost his job as a punishment.</p><p><img decoding=async title="The White Officer Preston Hemphill" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-White-Officer-Preston-Hemphill.jpg alt="The White Officer Preston Hemphill" width=450 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>From Where is Preston Hemphill?</strong></h2><p>According to sources,&nbsp;Preston Hemphill (age 26)&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;July 1996&nbsp;in Tennessee in a catholic family. Sources also revealed that he belongs to an affluent family, although we do not know the names of his father and mother. Hemphill spent his entire childhood in Memphis and completed his education.</p><p>After graduation, he did a few jobs for a while and joined Memphis Police Force. For approximately 3 years, he served as a Police Officer in Tennessee, and nobody knew how sick his behavior was toward others.</p><p>On January 7, 2023, he used aggressive measures while dealing with Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop which was later confirmed by a bodycam clip. When Tyre ran for his life, Preston could be heard saying, “I hope they stomp his ass,” which clearly confirms that he was not professional while doing his job.</p><p><img decoding=async title="White Memphis police officer Preston Hemphill" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-Memphis-police-officer-Preston-Hemphill.jpg alt="White Memphis police officer Preston Hemphill" width=400 height=309 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Preston Hemphill Hiding His Identity</strong></h2><p>Twenty days after the death of Tyre, Hemphill got fired and got recognized as the person that used the taser gun. He knows he has done a heinous task, and the fear of facing criticism from the public made him delete all his social media accounts, including Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>The Memphis Police Department must also receive some credit because the department officials did their best to protect him from the eyes of protestors and the media.</p><h2><strong>Preston Hemphill Q&A</strong></h2><p>Ques: What is the name of the white officer who tased Tyre Nichols?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;Preston Hemphill.</p><p>Ques: When was Preston Hemphill born?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;July 1996.</p><p>Ques: How old is Preston Hemphill?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;26 (in 2022).</p><p>Ques: Is Preston Hemphill present on Instagram?</p><p>Ans:&nbsp;No.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmqaqVqMGwuoyhnKaomJ65rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
