[It] turns out you make MUCH better art when you involve millions of people in the process.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Despite not having been released, the album has already received over 600 million Spotify streams, which speaks something about how enthusiastic his fans are. It heralds the much-awaited comeback of our favourite singer-songwriter after a long break. Charlie described it as his most personal work to date, with every song authentically representing a piece of himself, both sonically and lyrically.</p><p>With that said, we can’t wait to see what Charlie is going to serve on our music palette. However, we are confident that it’s going to be a savoury, sweet, and smashing success, with massive support from his devoted fans.</p><p>Charlie features Puth’s explosive high-beam singles, “<a href=#>Light Switch</a>,” the foot-tapping “<a href=#>That’s Hilarious</a>,” and power collaboration, “Left and Right,” which emphasize the upcoming album’s soundscapes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stream and listen to “Smells Like Me” on all global digital streaming platforms!</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-save /pre-order ‘CHARLIE’ here- out on October 7</a>.</p><p><strong>Share your thoughts with us on Twitter at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@CelebMix!</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksKmt0aWgnmWgqsGpecyorKumo2K1qr%2BMoZyaqqSXv6atymamp2WemsRuv8innqWdXai6prjLrGSloZuaeq6xjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
