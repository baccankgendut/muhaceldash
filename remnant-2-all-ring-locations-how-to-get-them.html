There are several rings to track down, and it can be difficult to keep track of them all. Here’s what you need to know about where to find all ring locations and how to get them in Remnant 2."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Each ring will have a unique passive that can influence your character’s gameplay, and you typically want them to influence how you use your character’s Archetype, their class, throughout the game. Some might work better than others, and it also comes down to what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">type of weapon</a>, skills, and traits you’ve been upgrading.</p><p>It is extremely important to note that in my experience, <strong>the locations of these rings do vary for every playthrough of Remnant 2</strong>. Although select rings appear in the same biome, they might not appear in the exact location. For example, the Feedback Loop ring was initially found in my first playthrough while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exploring N’Erud</a>, but on a second playthrough, it still appeared on N’Erud, but in a different region on my second character.</p><p data-injection=true>Hopefully, this guide gives you an idea of where you can expect to find these rings, and if you don’t find them with your character after beating the game, reroll the world to get a new set of areas, and more loot to obtain while playing Remnant 2.</p><p>These are all of the rings and where you can expect to find them in Remnant 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Alchemy-Stone-Ring-in-Remnant-2.jpg><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
