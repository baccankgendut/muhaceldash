Thank you Twitter for tonight and all of the Thursday nights. It's such an honor. #Scandal," the Felicity alum wrote, taking his final bow.</p><p>Castmate <strong>Joshua Malina</strong> (who plays <strong>David Rosen</strong>) weighed in on the moment. "It has been a real pleasure working with @scottfoley," he wrote. "Very kind. Especially from you. #scandal," replied Foley.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While fans reeled from the fact that Foley's characters seemed destined to meet a sticky end (his Grey's Anatomy gig as <strong>Henry Burton</strong> also ended in tragedy), the 42-year-old dad of three might be under pressure to find a new acting role soon!</p><p>Earlier in April, his wife <strong>Marika Dominczyk</strong> tweeted a message during a Scandal episode where her husband's character was involved in a fight.</p><p>"Uhhhh don't kill jake!
