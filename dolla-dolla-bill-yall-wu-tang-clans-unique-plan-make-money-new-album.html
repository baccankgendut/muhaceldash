While the former will be released in standard album form in July, the latter isn't going to be released at all. Rather, the double-album, produced by Moroccan-based producer Tarik "Cilvaringz" Azzougarh, is undergoing a very unique marketing strategy.</p><p>The group will make exactly <strong>one</strong> copy of the double-album. That's not a typo. Wu-Tang will produce one copy. Instead of mass producing hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of physical albums, they're gonna make just one. So how do you hear it? Wu-Tang is planning to lock the album inside an engraved nickel and silver box designed by a British-Moroccan artist named Yahya. The box will travel the world to various museums and art galleries. Those who want to hear the album will have to pay the admission price then they will be given a set of headphones to listen one time all the way through. No copying, no downloading. One listen, and done. As you can imagine, there will always be constant heavy security surrounding the album. No word yet on what style of headphones the listener gets to wear.</p><p>It's an interesting marketing gimmick, certain to gain the approval from bands like Metallica and Radiohead, who have always been against the sharing of music online. But will people actually turn up to listen? And will they get to at least sit down? A double-album can be mighty rough on the feet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJom6iknJZ6pbvLpZhmmpmhuW7FwKWjZq%2BlYsGiusZmmqWZnqh6trrIqqyeZaChrq95zJqinmWdpLumxYynnLBlkaGvtrmO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
