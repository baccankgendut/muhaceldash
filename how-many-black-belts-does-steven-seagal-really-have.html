The man in question was Gene LeBell, a bona fide martial arts legend who <a href=#>Uproxx</a> tells us was still at the ringside for fellow judoka and fighter of some note Ronda Rousey when he was 79 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>As the story goes, "Judo" Gene was a spry 58 when he served as the fight choreographer for Seagal vehicle&nbsp;Out For Justice.&nbsp;When Seagal boasted that he had the moves to ensure that he simply couldn't be choked out, LeBell happily took up the challenge. As a result of this very brief altercation, Seagal passed out so hard that he ... well, evacuated his bowels. In front of about thirty stuntmen and crew members, if you believe LeBell.</p><p>To be entirely fair, LeBell is perfectly cordial about the incident and says he respects Seagal as a martial artist, though he points out that the aikido master would do well if he abstained from speaking in potential foot-in-mouth (or, as it happens, poop-in-pants) situations. It should also be noted that LeBell has been known to tell a tale or two in his time, and Seagal himself vehemently denies this ever happened. Still, one would probably be forgiven for not betting on Seagal in a judo match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l25tbmhfnby4ecyapbJlkqGupLeMm5ylrKNisbCx0maqrZ2mmrtuv8SanpqkXaeyorjLsmShmaaafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
