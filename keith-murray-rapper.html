However, his appearances of both versions of I Shot Ya led to brief friction with rapper Tupac Shakur, who believed that the song was a diss towards him being shot and robbed at Quad Recording Studios, regarding the timing, title, and lyrical content. Sometime in the following year, Tupac Shakur approached <a href=#>Keith Murray</a> at the California House Of Blues, wanting to know if the record was a diss to him. Upon questioning, Murray made it clear that the record was not about Shakur, peacefully resolving the situation. Murray has continued to publicly addressed this in several interviews over the following years.</p><p>He released his fifth solo album Rap-Murr-Phobia on July 31, 2007. It debuted at number 52 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The lead single was "Nobody Do It Better" featuring Tyrese and Junior.</p><p>After Murray was released from prison, he signed with Def Jam who released He's <a href=#>Keith Murray</a> in 2003, once again to critical and commercial success. The album contained the single "Yeah Yeah U Know It.", and featured guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, Redman and Jamie Foxx, among others. The same year, Murray was featured as a playable character in the video game Def Jam Vendetta. Despite the success and acclaim of his first album on Def Jam after this, Murray was dropped from the label just one day after its release after being accused of choking two label employees, although he said the confrontation was limited to words. After being released, Murray announced plans to continue recording music independently.</p><p>In 1995, Murray was arrested after being accused of hitting a man with a barstool in a fight. He was released on bail, but eventually sentenced to three years in prison in 1998. Murray, who maintains his innocence, fled from authorities after his sentence until turning himself in in October 1998. Murray initially filed a lawsuit for wrongful conviction, but agreed to drop the suit in exchange for his sentence being reduced by three months. Murray served the latter portion of his sentence in the Maple Street Halfway House facility before being released on May 14, 2001.</p><p>In 1998, Murray and The Def Squad released their debut album, El Niño, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA.</p><p>Murray's third solo album It's a Beautiful Thing was released in 1998 while Murray was incarcerated for assault.</p><p>Murray's second album Enigma was released on November 26, 1996 on Jive, once again to critical acclaim. The album peaked at number 39 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and reached number 6 on the R&B Albums chart. Murray also continued to work with other artists, appearing on tracks by Busta Rhymes, UGK, Redman and Jamal.</p><p>In 1994, he was introduced to <a href=#>Erick Sermon</a> of EPMD by his friend K-Solo. Sermon included Murray on his album No Pressure on the single "Hostile", with critics praising Murray's lyrical ability. His appearance on Hostile led to Murray being signed to Jive Records, and work began on his first album. Murray's debut single, The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World was released in 1994 and was a hit. The song was produced by <a href=#>Erick Sermon</a> (who also provided background vocals) and peaked at number 50 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. Murray's debut album The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World, was named after the single and released in 1994 to widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August 1995. The album was also given 4 mics by The Source.</p><p>Murray debuted his spaced out, complex, multi-syllable rhyming style on Erick Sermon's ruggedly produced song 'Hostile' off his first solo album 'No Pressure' which was released in 1993, and was Sermon's first project since splitting with former rhyming partner <a href=#>Parrish Smith</a>. In 1994, Jive Records released Murray's debut single, The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World which was quickly followed up by his debut album of the same name, released to both critical acclaim and commercial success.
