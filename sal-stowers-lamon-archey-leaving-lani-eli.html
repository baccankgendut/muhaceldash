It was wonderful while it lasted, but if we’re being honest, it was way too brief! Because Sal Stowers and Lamon Archey have already wrapped up their Days of Our Lives stints as Lani and Eli. We’d been waiting for what felt like ages, seeing as how Lani was supposed to be released from prison in time for the holidays, only to learn that delays were holding it up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because Sal Stowers and Lamon Archey have already wrapped up their&nbsp;Days of Our Lives&nbsp;stints as Lani and Eli. We’d been waiting for what felt like ages, seeing as how Lani was supposed to be released from prison in time for the holidays, only to learn that delays were holding it up.</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Who’s going to kill Clyde?</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately (though not for the family), Lani was finally released just as Paulina was dying from heart failure. “Elani” came home to Salem and the family was reunited for the first time since Abe’s disappearance over the summer. And we mean all&nbsp;of the family <span>—</span> in theory. The cameras always seemed to just miss poor Jules and Carver. But it couldn’t last.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chanel-lani-hug-paulina-hospital-bed-days-jj.png alt="Sitting on either side of Paulina on a hospital bed, Chanel and Lani smile as they lean their heads to hers." width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After all of our time wondering who would die to leave their heart to Paulina,&nbsp;Days of Our Lives&nbsp;pulled a fast one on us and revealed that&nbsp;no&nbsp;one would! Instead, Lexie came down from heaven as an Angel, helped Abe regain his memories and bring Paulina back from the brink of death. While we weren’t entirely sure that would be a permanent fix, it looks like it was! Because on today’s episode, she received the news that her heart was, miraculously, fine.</p><p>And with that news, “Elani” decided they were no longer needed in Salem. They hinted that this would happen when Eli mentioned the possible FBI job offer and he finally got word on the position right after Paulina and Abe recovered. He’ll be a part time FBI special agent consulting with the Department of Justice… in Washington DC.</p><p>Paulina reluctantly gave them her blessing to go, but at least they stuck around long enough to congratulate Chanel and Johnny on their remarriage and to reconnect with Abe for real (for about two minutes) now that he’s gotten his memory back.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JPI_Episode14803_0002050959-e1709159672782.jpg alt="Days' Lani hugging Paulina in the hospital bed, as Eli hugs Abe and Chanel watches from the door" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It’s not a complete surprise that they didn’t stick around, though, as Stowers is busy over on BET’s Sistas and Archey’s been recurring on The CW’s All American&nbsp;since its second season. In other words, they’ve been keeping plenty busy in primetime!</p><p>Last time they left, of course, we all knew Lani’s prison sentence was temporary and expected to see them both back in Salem once it was over. This time, though, they’re just moving away. That doesn’t mean they’re gone for good <span>—</span> they’ve still got their families back in Salem <span>—</span> but Days of Our Lives&nbsp;history is littered with characters and families who move away, never to be seen for years and years, if ever.</p><p>Fingers crossed this isn’t the case for “Elani,” but for now all we know is it’s time to say farewell once again!</p><p><strong>Take a peek at our photo gallery of Lani and Eli’s love story <a href=# rel=noopener>from start to, well, now, here</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOnKamoZ6cwG6tzZ1koKeZo7S0e5ZraG5raGTAoriMrKuor5WnwG64wKamp2WRp7Cpsdhmo56Zpp67qHnLmqWiZZWhtnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
