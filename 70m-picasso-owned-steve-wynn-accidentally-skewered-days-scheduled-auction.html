But according to auction house Christie's scant public comment on the incident, a paint roller leaning against a wall fell and the attached pole punctured the canvas of the painting "during the final stages of preparation," as reported by Bloomberg.</p><p>In one of those nightmarish domino effects one can see in the world of fine art, the accident caused not just&nbsp;Le Marin but another of the trio of paintings (another Picasso entitled&nbsp;Femme au chat assise dans un fauteuil)&nbsp;to&nbsp;be pulled from the auction block as well, as both works were guaranteed to sell by the same third party.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-259023 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-954263870.jpg alt width=900 height=636 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-259023 class=wp-caption-text>DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Le Marin&nbsp;had a pre-sale estimate of $70 million, but fortunately for Wynn his plans for these three paintings didn't completely collapse. The third painting,&nbsp;Double <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> [Ferus Type], a portrait of Elvis Presley by <a href=# title="Andy Warhol Net Worth">Andy Warhol</a> from 1963, did end up selling for $37 million against a pre-sale estimate of $30 million.</p><p>Wynn's attorney&nbsp;Michael Kosnitzky said, unsurprisingly, that Wynn was "angry about it," referring to the damaged painting, and that the incident qualified as&nbsp;"gross, flagrant negligence," but it's not yet known what the next step will be or if the damage to the painting will be able to be repaired. Hopefully for not just Wynn and everyone else with a financial interest, but also art lovers all over the world, it will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfbH2uec%2Bimpqro6R6sMPNnptmq6Saw6Z51rKlp2WRmLCqsMSnq5qknK56tLfEsJyrnZRisaLF0maqnKCVmcKtscNmmK6bpJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
