Bo was perfectly happy to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> live on farm</a> and create content for YouTube. Now, he has teased that he may be making a return soon.</p><p>Bo Dallas recently appeared at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“For the Love of Wrestling”</a> event where he was asked about a possible run in All Elite Wrestling. Dallas said he does plan to wrestle again within the next three months. He has his sights set on one of his greatest opponents from NXT.</p><p>Bo said he would love to work with PAC again. As Adrian Neville, PAC defeated Bo Dallas for the NXT Championship in 2014. The two kickstarted the hottest period in the promotional brand’s history.</p><p>Dallas never got to shine during his time in WWE after moving on from developmental. AEW has plenty of fresh matchups and a completely different perspective on booking. It could be the perfect place for a comeback.</p><p>Time will tell if AEW has any interest in Bo Dallas. The roster is already stacked from top to bottom. With Ring of Honor working on a TV deal, that load may be getting lighter. Bo Dallas would love to be along for the ride.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
