Three big arguments that reinstate your power, remind everyone who’s in charge, be the predator.’ That is the opposite of my process. And I want none of that ... The no a–holes policy, it puts everybody on the same level."</p><p>During another interview with Variety in August 2022, Wilde explained why LaBeouf left. “I say this as someone who is such an admirer of his work. His process was not conducive to the ethos that I demand in my productions,” she claimed.</p><p>Further in her interview, Wilde went on to explain that she wanted Pugh to feel as comfortable as possible with her scene partner. “A lot came to light after this happened that really troubled me, in terms of his behavior,” she continued. “For our film, what we really needed was an energy that was incredibly supportive. Particularly with a movie like this, I knew that I was going to be asking Florence to be in very vulnerable situations, and my priority was making her feel safe and making her feel supported. I find myself just really wishing [Shia] health and evolution because I believe in restorative justice."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZvK%2FAjLCmq6qpYrGivsuipaBllKeurq2MsJ%2BarF2kuarCyJpksKGcmbJuuc6rnGagkauybr%2FAopto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
