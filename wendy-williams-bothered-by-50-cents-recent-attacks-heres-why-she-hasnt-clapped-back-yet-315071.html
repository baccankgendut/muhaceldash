Wendy is a very smart businesswoman and she’s told those close to her she knows everyone’s going to be tuning in then with everything going on in her life, so she plans to address everything then. It’s a good business plan to wait. She can’t wait to talk about everything.’</p><p>In the meantime, 50 Cent went as far as to call Wendy a ‘monster’ and ‘ugly.’</p><p>These insults followed the footage featuring Wendy outside his pool party that he shared.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The rapper made sure she would not be let inside and filmed her seemingly begging the security guard for access to the bash for her and a group of friends.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnBqKuhnaKasW6u2GZsaWWTmru1v4yrnJydnql6osDTmpqkq12dsrOx0mauobFdqLWmeceaqqesXZi5orzPnptmmpGYuG7FxK1kbGllZYRyew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
