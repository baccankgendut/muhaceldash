They were seen together with the pop singer’s father, Ed Butera, on a rare outing in New York City a few days before Christmas.</p><p>According to a close source of Grande, they dined at her family’s preferred Italian restaurant with her father and relatives. Heading to dinner, the group looked to be in high spirits as they got out of their black luxury SUV.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Grande, 30, looked stunning in an all-black outfit that included a matching bucket hat, button-down sweater with fur-lined sleeves, miniskirt, and semi-sheer tights.</p><p>She accessorized with dazzling crystal earrings and a black purse, wearing a long black coat over her arms.</p><p>She looked to be wearing more of a honey-colored hairstyle than the platinum blonde she has been rocking in the movie “Wicked,” which is how she met Slater. Furthermore, Grande also added a pop of color with red lipstick.</p><p>On the other hand, Slater wore all black like his girlfriend, but he dressed more comfortably in a North Face zip-up and Nike sports pants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ariana-Grande-and-Ethan-Slater-1024x576.jpg><p>Afterward, they all went to see Ethan perform in “Spamalot,” a Broadway production. The couple enjoys helping each other out at work. She enjoys visiting the theater whenever she can after work.”</p><p>As you are aware, Grande has been recording new music in the studio. Besides her catchy music, her distinct style and powerful vocal range are other reasons for Grande’s popularity.</p><p>Only a few weeks after it was rumored that Grande and Slater moved in together, the couple was also seen packing on the PDA during a dinner date in the Big Apple in late October.</p><p>“They are happy together and are good for each other,” even though the couple has largely kept their relationship private. “All of Grande’s friends adore him.”</p><p>The “7 Rings” singer has not held back when it comes to endorsing Ethan. Wearing a crown from the musical Spamalot, Ariana attended the first night of previews in New York City on Halloween while holding up a playbill.</p><p>The Grammy winner’s wide smile as she left the theater suggested that she was enamored as well.&nbsp;</p><p>They were also spotted together on November 12 at the Broadway play. The two even stopped by Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells’ backstage area to have a conversation.</p><p>Less than a year has passed since the “Thank You, Next” singer and Dalton Gomez filed for divorce after two years of marriage. The ex-couples gave the excuse of “irreconcilable differences” in court filings.</p><p>The reports stated that before filing, “they were taking their time together to slowly work through the details of the agreement privately.” “They have been kind and respectful to one another during the entire process. The process of uncoupling has been extremely gentle and patient.”</p><p>The exact date that Ariana and Ethan started dating is unknown, but rumors have it that it happened a few months after they first connected on the Wicked set, where filming started in December 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Ariana plays Glinda the Good Witch in the upcoming musical film, and Ethan plays Boq, a character who harbors feelings for Glinda.</p><p>Following their separate divorces, it was reported at the beginning of October that Ariana and Ethan were living together. According to multiple US outlets, they have moved in together in New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51ktbC4y7KuqKeUZLG2vsinnmaZXZm2r7rEq2SdmaSaeqq6jKewnGWRp7aiusBmnquZnpmybq3NnWShnaJir7DFxaugnqaUYrK1tMCnZKykkamys3nWnqmeZaOlvLXAxJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
