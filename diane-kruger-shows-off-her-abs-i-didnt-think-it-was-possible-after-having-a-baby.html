She’s been training with Hannah Bower – someone who specializes in pre and post-natal fitness – for a few months. Diane gave birth to Baby Girl Kruger-Reedus <a href=#>at some point</a> last fall, although we don’t know the exact date. I think it was probably late October, which would make Diane less than five months postpartum. And her abs are already back. She posted the IG with this message:</p><p>Am I showing off ? F–k yeah. ‘cause it’s been hard work to get my abs back. I didn’t think it was possible after having a baby. And certainly not at my age. I want to thank @hannahbower2 for sharing her journey and helping me get motivated. I don’t have a trainer, but I’ve been committed to get my body back. For myself first….but also for my 👻 The female body is AMAZING 😉</p><p><a href=#>[From Instagram]</a></p><p>She says she doesn’t have a trainer, but she thanks Hannah Bower, who is a trainer. Semantics, I guess. Anyway, what are the thoughts on this kind of postpartum brag? I like that she’s not dressing it up as anything other than what is it, which is that she’s proud of her bounceback and she’s worked hard for it. I also just think that regular women shouldn’t look to celebrity women for body-inspo when it comes to this kind of thing. Diane obviously has to look a certain way for her job, and she has the time and resources to really focus on “getting her abs back.” As for getting her body back for “myself first but also for my [ghost emoji]…” is that a reference to Norman Reedus? Huh. Anyway, I still find Diane shady. I’m shocked that she didn’t find some way to <a href=#>diss</a> <a href=#>Joshua Jackson</a> in this Instagram post.</p><p>Here are some photos of Diane at the Cesar Awards on February 22nd. Her body had already snapped back a month ago, basically.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn36055690.jpg alt="Cesar Film Awards 2019 - Ceremony" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wenn36055686.jpg alt="Cesar Film Awards 2019 - Ceremony" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN and Instagram.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmb2ljboZ4e8OimKedj6C%2FtrPEq5asoJ%2BswKC7xZ%2BWoZ2ilK6jv76ilp2hlKPBoMDHoqWkl5mprLit0pinqKujnq%2Btsb6ana2dopS1osLIp56YmY%2BXrqPFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
