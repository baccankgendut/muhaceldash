"Praying so much for y'all," Dillard wrote in the comments section of Schisler's <a href=#>Instagram</a> post. On her daughter's first birthday, Schisler appeared frail, sitting in a wheelchair with her toddler in her lap. Days later, Schisler died. A broken hearted Dillard shared the news on her Instagram Stories. "We have [known] each other for years and were in the same small group at church for several years. We were pregnant together last year and had our babes just a couple weeks apart,"&nbsp;she wrote.</p><p>Taking time to reflect on a "fleeting" life, Dillard called on her devout Christian faith to find solace after her friend's death. "I am also reminded of the story of Lazarus...where Jesus (God in flesh, the creator of heaven and earth) still wept when he lost his friend. He grieved. He wept even though he knew that he would raise Lazarus from the dead just a few moments later," Dillard wrote on Instagram. Although the tragedies we face in life aren't always easy to explain, Dillard is doing her best to cope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlaX1zfo6joKWkXZnCqLPAq2StqpGctqR5y6iqrGWWp7amusNmmpqmk5q%2FbrDInpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
