Christmas at the Boothstowes.”</p><p>The couple, who met on season 11 of The Bachelorette, created the last name “Boothstowe” after getting engaged in May 2015, but they aren’t in a hurry to tie the knot.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We are still just busy and so happy where we are right now and having a great time. When the time is right then we will start planning but <a href=#>there hasn’t been any planning yet</a>,” Booth told Us in September. “The best part [is] that our families and friends haven’t put any pressure [on us] once. There hasn’t been any mention of it and I think our families love that we are taking our time, seeing how we met in a very unconventional way. They just want us to be happy.”</p><p>He also added that he does feel “a little bit of pressure” from his fiancée’s dad who “brings it up every once in a while.”</p><p>The couple also admitted they would consider a TV wedding if the opportunity was right. “Watching <strong>Carly [Waddell]</strong> and <strong>Evan [Bass’]</strong> wedding and just being there was such a beautiful ceremony,” he told Us. “If that was something offered to us we would definitely think about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmpubq6jJupoqukpMSmecaonKxlpKS9rbHSrGSopl2YtbO10q2kmqtdrLa1tIysn5qvnmKvsLvToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
