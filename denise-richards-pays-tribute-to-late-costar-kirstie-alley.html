Her laugh was infectious & she lit up every room she walked into. Kirstie you are loved by so many & will be so very missed. Prayers to your kids & grandkids.”</p><p>The Cheers alum played Gladys Leeman, mother of Becky Leeman (Richards) in Drop Dead Gorgeous, a satirical comedy that followed beauty pageant hopefuls in a fictional Minnesota town.
