Talks of Jaden being gay by some of his fans gained more ground after the rapper claimed he was in a relationship with Tyler the Creator. However, despite that revelation, Jaden Smith never came out openly to declare that he is gay.</strong></p><p>Besides, a few months later, he was reportedly in relationships with Kylie Jenner and Cara Delevingne. And as per recent reports, Will Smith’s son is currently dating a female American model and social media influencer named Sab Zada. However, fans are still uncertain as to whether Jaden Smith is gay or not.</p><h2><strong>What Is Jaden Smith’s Sexuality?</strong></h2><p>American actor and rapper Jaden Smith, best known for his appearance in “The Karate Kid,” has never directly revealed his sexuality, but <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he once admitted</a> that Tyler The Creator was his boyfriend. He announced a live performance at Camp Flog Naw in November 2018, where Smith spoke highly of Tyler, describing him as one of his closest friends while stating that they’ve been in a relationship for a long time even though Tyler may not want it to be public yet.</p><p>However, during Jaden’s revelation, Tyler’s reaction on camera showed him shrugging and giggling behind the stage. Although he was wearing a face mask, his reaction seemingly deny the claims. It’s possible that the statement by Jaden was merely a playful joke, but their close relationship is well-known regardless.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith and Tyler The Creator’s Relationship: Are They Dating?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Jaden-Smith-and-Tyler-the-Creator-photo-Metro.jpg><p>Jaden later took to Twitter to express his love for Tyler, although the tweet has since been deleted. However, Tyler’s response to the tweet is still visible on the platform, as per dotcomseries. To this, Tyler simply responded about how “crazy” he sounded. Moreover, when Tyler won the 2020 Grammy award for Best Rap Album, Jaden immediately went on to Twitter to post about how his “Boyfriend” had just won the Grammy. However, this was a mere friendly trolling and both have denied any sexually-related relationship.</p><p>Because Jaden Smith has dated several women in the past, one cannot presume his sexual orientation or identity. He was reportedly in a relationship with a model named Sarah Snyder for two years between 2015 and 2017. Many songs on Jaden’s debut studio album have references to Sarah and their relationship. In addition, Jaden reportedly also dated an influencer and model named Sab Zada in 2022. Hence one cannot suppose Jaden Smith’s sexual orientation.</p><h2><strong>Highlight of Jaden Smith’s Past Girlfriends</strong></h2><p>In the past, Jaden Smith has been rumored to be in relationships with several models, such as Kylie Jenner and Cara Delevingne. However, his supposed relationship with Jenner has often been rebuked by both parties.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith Dated Madison Pettis from 2010 to 2011</strong></h3><p>Madison Pettis is believed to be Jaden Smith’s first girlfriend. Jaden and Madison met in high school and started dating, although their relationship wasn’t as popular. Madison would grow up to become a famous actress starring in numerous blockbuster movies like The Game Plan and Cory in the House. Likewise, she is one of the most prominent stars from the 2000s. Madison and Jaden’s relationship lasted for one year between 2010 and 2011.</p><h3><strong>Stella Hudgens was Jaden Smith’s Love Interest from 2011 Through 2012</strong></h3><p>Before Jaden’s relationship with Kylie Jenner in 2011, he started a relationship with American singer and actress Stella Hudgens. Stella is popular movies for her appearance in movies like Powerless, Players, and Smoky Knights. They dated between July 2011 and August 2012, or for more than a year.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith and&nbsp; Sofia Richie Had a Short-term Relationship From 2012 to 2013</strong></h3><p>Lionel Richie may be one of the best singers in the music industry. His talent is undisputed. But his daughter Sofia Richie did have good eyes for a boyfriend. However, the relationship between Sofia Richie and Jaden Smith lasted less than three months. The two dated between November 2012 and January 2013.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith and Kylie Jenner were Together in 2013</strong></h3><p>Of all the girls rumored to be dating Jaden Smith, Kylie Jenner is probably the richest. Kylie and Jaden were reportedly in a relationship in 2013, although the story of how their relationship began is unknown. However, their romance didn’t last longer than eight months, starting from March to October. The rumors are that both celebrities are still good friends even after the breakup.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith was Rumored to be Dating Sarah Snyder from 2015 to 2017</strong></h3><p>Sarah Snyder is a well-recognized American model, influencer, and popular actress who is famous for two reasons. Firstly, for allegedly shoplifting a $15,995 Hermes bag, and secondly, for being the girlfriend of Jaden Smith. Apart from that, her primary source of earnings is modeling for local and international brands. The story of Sarah and Jaden’s breakup is quite confusing, and Jaden’s fans hate her for leaving him. Sarah’s romance with Jaden started in 2015 and ended in 2017.</p><p>However, before Sarah, Jaden was rumored to be in a relationship with American actress Amandla Stenberg. Amandla is a very popular actress. She won an NAACP Image Award, a Teen Choice Award, nominations for four Black Reel Awards, and a Critics’ Choice Award. However, the relationship between Jaden and Amandla wasn’t official. It started as a rumor after the pair were spotted together at their High School Prom.</p><h3><strong>Jaden Smith was in a Relationship With Odessa Adlon Between 2017 – 2018</strong></h3><p>Before the rumors of Jaden being in a relationship with Tyler, The Creator, he was reportedly dating Odessa Adlon. She is the daughter of a popular actress named Pamela Adlon. Similarly, Odessa is a superstar actress who has starred in some critically acclaimed shows like FAM and Netflix’s Grand Army.</p><p>The amazing thing about Odessa and Jaden’s relationship is that they did everything in secret and didn’t even announce their breakup. So, there still might be chances that they’re still dating (or maybe not). Jaden and Odessa reportedly dated between 2017 and 2018.</p><h2><strong>Who is Jaden Smith Dating?</strong></h2><p>As of the time of writing this, Jaden Smith is reportedly in a relationship with an American model and social media influencer named Sab Zada. While Jaden was born on the 8th of July 1998 and is currently 25 years old, Sab Zada, on the other hand, was born on June 18, 1999, and is not younger than 24 years old.</p><p>The rumor of Jaden Smith dating the model first sparked in September 2020 after they were photographed holding hands and looking all romantic on a dinner date. Since being seen together, the two have been going strong in their relationship, and to a large extent, it is now a truism to believe that Jaden Smith is not a gay man. At least for the time being, he is still dating Sab Zada.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmoqtdn66lsc1mqqahpJ16qK3YZpinnF2ZvKa%2FjKGcZqCRq7JurYybprKeop6yr7CMqKlmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
