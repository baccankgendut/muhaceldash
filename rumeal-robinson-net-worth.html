During his six NBA seasons, Rumeal Robinson earned around $4.8 million in salary. Unfortunately his post-NBA life has been filled with legal and financial problems.</p><h2 id=legal-financial-issues><strong>Legal and Financial Issues</strong></h2><p>After retiring from the NBA, Robinson moved to Miami where he set out to become a real estate developer. One goal was to build a 25,000 acre resort in his native Jamaica. Unfortunately he was not able to secure a loan or a line of credit from any of the banks he visited. He was eventually referred to a bank in Iowa called the Community State Bank where a loan officer named <a href=# title="Brian Williams Net Worth">Brian Williams</a> approved him for a $377,000 bridge loan. Robinson allegedly paid $100,000 of the loan directly to Williams as a bribe to grease the process going froward. Over the next 1.5 years, Robinson received $1.2 million in loans from Community State Bank. He never paid a dime of his loan payments and instead of using the money to develop real estate, Robinson bought jewelry, clothes, motorcycles and more.</p><p>After the fraud was uncovered, Community State Bank sued Robinson to recoup the money. The bank would ultimately only recoup around 5%. During one court proceeding, Robinson claimed to have no net worth and lived from one twenty dollar bill to the next. He claimed his only possession was a change of pants.</p><p>Robinson was soon indicted on bank fraud, bank bribery, wire fraud and several other charges. His own adoptive mother would claim that Robinson swindled her out of her home.</p><p>On September 8, 2010 he was convicted on 11 counts. A year later he was sentenced to 6 ½ years in prison. He was also ordered to pay $1.184 million in restitution. He was released in 2016.</p><p>In March 2012, a federal judge ruled that $370,000 of Robinson's NBA pension fund could be seized and used to pay down his restitution.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-268141 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-1388313-e1606869542468.jpg alt width=380 height=368 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-268141 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life-college><strong>Early Life and College</strong></h2><p>Rumeal Robinson was born in Mandeville, Jamaica in November 1966.
