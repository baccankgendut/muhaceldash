(<a href=#>It was blue and black</a>.) Then came the <a href=#>Yanny vs. Laurel</a> divide sparked by an audio clip of a computer-generated voice saying the word ‘Laurel’ in a deep male voice, or the word ‘Yanny’ in a higher pitch, or perhaps <a href=#>both words</a> depending on what you wanted to hear. (<a href=# rel=noopener>It was Laurel,</a> by the way.) Now, comes the next great debate to divide the internet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A TikTok video making the rounds featuring a man’s voice saying either the word “brainstorm” or the words “green needle” and the word you hear seems to depend on which phrase you read on the screen or even which words you are thinking about as you hear them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Buzzfeed first reported, the video, which was uploaded by TikTok user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@emilysophie.m</a>, has gone massively viral on the platform, racking up 5 million views in just a few days as people try and crack the audio mystery surrounding the clip.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Dr. Kevin Franck, director of audiology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, <a href=#>told TIME</a>in reference to the great Yanny vs Laurel debate, what you hear “all comes down to the brain.” He said, “The fact that brains go in one way and some brains go in the other means that we’re all just wired a bit differently based on our experiences.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The brain is built to turn messy signals into meaning,” he says. “It just will not give you ambiguity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Interestingly, this is not the first time people have waded into a debate over “brainstorm” or “green needle”. The exact same issue was confounding people on Twitter back in 2018, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to BuzzFeed,</a> thanks to a YouTube video of a Ben 10 toy, which was then shared on Twitter, where it went viral.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While that toy was supposed to be saying brainstorm as it relates to Ben 10 costume, it tore the internet apart for a few days. Now it’s back to finish what it started.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGdog3ODjqCpnp2eYrumscOlnGaaopa2r7%2FTqKmmZZWtva2tyKecnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
