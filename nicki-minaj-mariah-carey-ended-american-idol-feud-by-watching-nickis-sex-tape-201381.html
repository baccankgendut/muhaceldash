Did you have a bottle of wine?" a reporter asked the ladies, who were joined by host <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> and fellow judges <a href=#><strong>Randy Jackson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a> on stage.</p><p>"I put on my sex tape," rapper Minaj, 30, joked. (Rumors have spread numerous times that the "Starships" singer has a sex tape, including reports in December 2010 and October 2012.)</p><p>"And there it is," Carey said. "The whole thing is convoluted. It's a distraction from the show and a distraction from the contestants."</p><p>"Every time we try to talk about the contestants, we have to field questions about [this]," Minaj complained.</p><p>"Time heals all wounds," Carey explained, to which Minaj added, "And we watched my tape . . . We're professionals. Have you ever had an argument with someone you work with?"</p><p>After video footage of their argument surfaced online, speculation swirled that the feud was stage.</p><p>"It's authentic," Mike Darnell, the President of Alternative Programming said. "They disagree about a lot of the talent. It's not just the girls, it's everybody."</p><p>So, could the two judges say something nice about each other during the panel?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I say nice things about Mariah all the time," Minaj said. "She's one of my favorite artists of all times. She's really shaped a generation of singers. To be on a panel with her, it's kind of crazy."</p><p>"That was obviously a very sweet thing to say," Carey replied. "Nicki and I worked together very early on in her career and did a song — it's called 'Up Out My Face,' ironically. I did know, and feel, she was going to go very far."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5ueeq61zZqhZqWRp7aitIycmKudqWKyr7DEnWSapZWntqStzWagnaecYrOmwcNmmbJlp5bBpLTIp55mppmYuKq%2FjKycsWWklr2meZFpaGxwYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
