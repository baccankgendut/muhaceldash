Lindsay really likes her privacy.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Parent Trap&nbsp;</i></a>actress, 35, and the businessman <a href=#>announced their engagement in November 2021</a>.</p><p class=p1>“My love. My life. My family. My future.&nbsp;@bader.shammas&nbsp;#love&nbsp;<span class=s1>💍</span>,” Lohan captioned an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;gallery at the time, <a href=#>showing off her giant Harry Winston ring</a>.</p><p class=p1>The pair, who were first linked in 2019, have <a href=#>kept their relationship relatively low-key</a> though her loved ones approve of the union.</p><p class=p1>“Everyone loves [Bader],” the source tells&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “He’s such a great guy. They don’t go out a lot, she is always cooking. Lindsay has become very humble, domesticated and centered.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Freaky Friday&nbsp;</i>actress’ mother, <a href=#><strong>Dina Lohan</strong></a>, previously gushed about her daughter’s relationship to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Lindsay is dating a wonderful guy right now,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, 59, <a href=#>exclusively told<i> Us</i> in April 2020</a>, noting that she was in “no rush” for Lindsay to settle down. “But that’s neither here nor there.

Everything is where it should be. It’s a cleansing of your head, which is what I needed, and it took me a while to do it. … I would love to own a place in New York, and that’s something I will look into in the future, but right now I’m okay with where I live.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “There’s&nbsp;a certain calmness that I find there&nbsp;[in Dubai]. There’s no paparazzi, no cameras; that’s a big deal for me. I never considered people taking a picture ‘bothering’ me, but I don’t want people to misinterpret who I am as a person if they see me sneezing and they say I’m crying. I do really appreciate having the life where I can just go outside and not have to worry.”</p><p class=p1>For more on the pair’s wedding plans, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeqHq4scOdoKefXaW5orrSZquoZZKWsaa%2BjKyfmqWdlsBuvsSvnJqklZl6pbHTmqClq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
