Pepper" as "rubbish," though it seems he was also of this opinion regarding his own band's forays into psychedelia, preferring instead to keep his riffs rounded in the blues and classic rock sound that he's famous for.</p><p dir=ltr>But in 2020, it appeared that McCartney was the most likely to cause bad blood between the two bands, with a comment he gave during an interview with <a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, describing The Stones as nothing more than a "blues cover band." Fans were quick to note the disrespectful tone of the comment. Still, months later Richards publicly addressed the supposed slight (via <a href=#>Variety</a>), revealing that he had received a message immediately after McCartney's interview was published, with the former Beatle assuring his fellow rocker that his comments had been taken out of context, and that The&nbsp;Stones had accepted the explanation. "Hey, Paul's a great guy, man," Richards added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlmxrcm1fqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqKeoaSderO1wqGYq5yjYq6vsIypmK6kXaKwpK3RraWesaNiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
