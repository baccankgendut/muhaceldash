She indicated that Chris was supposed to place an order on DoorDash for a few burgers, some fries, and two 10-piece boxes of McDonald’s McNuggets (20 in total) for the family.</p><p>However, Chris mistakenly ordered 20 sets of the 10-piece McNuggets, believing he was adding 20 individual nuggets instead of complete boxes. She humorously pointed out that neither of them had bothered to check the order before hitting confirm. ‘I think he mentioned, “Oh, wow, this is expensive,” but I was just, like, “Eh, who knows?”,’ Jessica said.&nbsp;Currently, purchasing 20 boxes of the 10-pack Chicken McNuggets on DoorDash would amount to $167.80.</p><p>Because of the size of the order, the delivery driver had to inform the family about the extended wait. They explained that it was a specially-made order. “‘We’re, like, “Sweet, that’s awesome. Fresh food!”,’ Jessica explained.</p><p>She mentioned that the driver was surprised to see only a few people when the food arrived. “‘I was, like, “Is this a prank?”,’ she wondered aloud when she saw the bags brimming with McNuggets.</p><p>However, the McNugget mayhem wasn’t for naught. The family decided against asking for a refund for their blunder. As a kind gesture, rather than discarding the food, they chose to distribute it to a group of homeless individuals. “We packed them up, and we went down to the beach, and we handed them out,” Jessica recalled.&nbsp;</p><p>“It turned out to be really awesome experience,” Jessica <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51ku6bD0miknJyfo66tsNJmpKKrmJa9brPOnqpmrpmnrq15wJ%2Brnqpdma6lecCcmqKclaPBorjLsmSoqpSav7R5kWlnZpuYnrCssc1mpJympZy0psDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
