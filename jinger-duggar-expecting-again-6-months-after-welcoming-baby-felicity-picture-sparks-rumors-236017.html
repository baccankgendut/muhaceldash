‘She loves cozy winter evenings with a good book and a cup of tea,’ the hubby wrote in the caption."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Maybe she is pregnant?’</p><p>Besides, even her in-laws started suspecting she was pregnant with baby Felicity last year during an episode when she said no to a cup of coffee.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s no wonder fans put so much importance on his particular detail.</p><p>But there were some who thought people assuming only based on that is ridiculous.</p><p>‘People ask some stupid questions,’ one follower commented, as another also agreed: ‘Shocker…coffee isn’t a drink for all day and you can have tea without being pregnant. Don’t be rude. Jeez.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It looks like it’s still going to take a couple of months or so to finally learn who is right in this debate.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeanruosdFmm66fl5a%2FbrHXqZycrJmjtG6txpqgp2VmYrqwutOhqmaZlqmys3nWnqOcp52eu6h5wZqZsmWWmrmqr8itsGaomZjBtr7EZqqpmaKgwG6%2B1Kamq6tdZ4B3fJBwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
