The legendary California-bred emcee who was shot and killed at the age of 25 still has a great impact on the lives of millions of people 20 years after his death. There is perhaps no bigger barometer of the impact Tupac had than the recent sale of a letter he wrote back in 1995.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A letter penned while he was incarcerated at New York's Clinton Correctional Facility, back in 1995, recently sold for $172,725, obliterating the early bid price of $11,000. The four page letter was written to Nina Bhareshwar, who was the publicist for Death Row Records at the time. Pac was incarcerated for allegedly sexually abusing a fan, and spent nine months in prison for the assault. He denied the assault in an interview three months before the letter was written.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In the letter, entitled "Is Thug Life Dead?" Pac offered a glimpse into "where [his] heart [was] at [the] time." He told Nina in a foreword of sorts, of the letter, that he wouldn't be granting the information contained in the letter "2 [sic] any other publication, not even <i>time</i> [sic] & <i>Rolling Stone," </i>and that he wanted her to "represent it as it is layed."</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He&nbsp;essentially gave an overview of his life from being a "young Dustkicker," to a "thug n***a," to a "Boss Playa." He told Nina of the encounter he had with Oakland police officers that "knocked [him] unconscious for jaywalking & saying F**k The Police." He also described his experience in the correctional facility from which he was writing the letter, stating that the correctional officers would openly call him "n****r," and that putting your hands on a correctional officer while in prison was "an automatic 7 years [in prison]."</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-231933 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pac-1.jpg alt width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-231933 class=wp-caption-text>VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Pac concluded the letter by saying "Beware of Playa Haters and evil envious 'homiez.' They will bring u harm. It ain't all good my people be aware! Hopefully this will do some of u some good. If it does then I don't sit in jail in vain." He also went on to promise the release of another album "4 the homiez," which he did shortly after his release, with the classic <i>All Eyez on Me.</i></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the identity of the person who bought the letter hasn't been disclosed, Ken Goldin of Goldin Auctions revealed that the winning bidder is a well-known person who beat out a popular entertainer for the historical piece of hip-hop memorabilia. `</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoo56spJq%2FbrzEp6WenF2pwrGtwmaqoZmbqr9uvNGiqqimXaiyrbjSZmhwamBlfXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
