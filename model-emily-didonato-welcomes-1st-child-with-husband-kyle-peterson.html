So excited to share with all of you that I am <a href=#>pregnant with a baby girl</a>.”</p><p>The New York native continued documenting her pregnancy progress via Instagram. “Is it a bump? Is it lunch? Or is it both?” she captioned June mirror selfies at 15 weeks. The following month, she asked her social media followers: “Does this dress make me look pregnant? The correct answer … is yes!”</p><p>The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model wed Peterson in June 2018 in Colorado after four years of dating.</p><p>The bride walked down the aisle in a “classic, strapless Oscar de la Renta dress,” telling Vogue, “Because I’ve worked as a model for years and have even done bridal modeling, every dress I tried on didn’t feel special enough. But when I found this … I immediately felt beautiful and timeless in it. I didn’t want any [jewelry] that would take away or distract — just delicate pieces for a little sparkle.”</p><p>She and the financier met in January 2014 while boarding a flight from New York to Denver, later discovering that they lived one block from each other and had mutual friends.</p><p>“I was flying from New York to Vail to shoot the cover of Australian Vogue, and Kyle was going for a work trip,” DiDonato told the magazine following her nuptials. “We were next to each other on that flight, started chatting, and have been together pretty much ever since!”</p><p>The Cornell University grad proposed in November 2016 on “the same bridge that his grandfather proposed to his grandmother on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>DiDonato is not the only Victoria’s Secret model to become a first-time mom in 2021. <a href=#><strong>Devon Windsor</strong> </a>gave birth to daughter Enzo with husband<strong> Johnny Dex Barbara</strong> in September, and<a href=#><strong> Elsa Hosk</strong> welcomed daughter Tuulikki</a> seven months prior.</p><p>“Happiest day of my life meeting you,” the Sweden native, 32, captioned an Instagram photo with partner<strong> Tom Daly</strong> at the time. “Proudest moment in my life giving birth to you.
