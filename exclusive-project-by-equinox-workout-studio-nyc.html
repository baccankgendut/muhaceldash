"We wanted to empower the brightest people in fitness with resources they’ve never had before."</p><p>The general idea of freewheeling fitness&nbsp;spaces for instructors to workshop new material&nbsp;has been circulating in the industry for some time (Bandier's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/bandier-flatiron-store-fitness-studio-music-venue/>Studio B</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/yg-studios-flatiron-space/>YG Studios</a>&nbsp;are a few examples), and other gym chains have started getting into the boutique business, too—Crunch Gym opened its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.sweatshed.com/>SweatShed</a> in Midtown, and New York Sports Clubs has partnered with specialty studios like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/first-look-bfxs-new-fidi-studio-fuses-cycling-and-strength-training-in-one-sweet-room/>BFX</a>, Cyc, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/inside-tone-house-huge-new-manhattan-studio/>Tone House</a> for its newest concept <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.newyorksportsclubs.com/lab>NYSC Lab</a>, which offers members a multidisciplinary approach to working out.</p><p>While Heckman notes that&nbsp;Equinox has no plans to replicate its boutique concept right now, she isn't ruling out the idea of an expansion.

Others, like those recruited for Project, are constantly itching to lunge outside of the lines. “These are people who want to write the script. They have ideas. They don’t like the lines that have been handed to them," she says.</p><p>There are currently nine trainers on the roster: Godso and her fellow Nike trainer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/3-reasons-you-should-really-add-yoga-to-your-race-training-plan/>Traci Copeland</a>;&nbsp;SLT star Patrick McGrath; Flywheel's&nbsp; Kenneth Ferrer; Equinox conditioning favorite Gerren Liles; Bec Donlan, creator of booty-focused brand Sweat with Bec; Travis Sisk, owner of Manifest Bodyworks&nbsp;Pilates studio in Brooklyn; Lauren Williams, a fitness model; and PJ McMahon, a Muay Thai and MMA fighter.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Project-by-Equinox-4.jpg></p><h2>It's taking a cafeteria approach with à la carte classes</h2><p>Unlike Equinox's members-only gyms, classes at Project are offered separately&nbsp;($35) and open to the public, a format that allows the audiences these trainers already attract (online and IRL) greater access to their talents.</p><p>And the schedule reflects the diversity of each instructor's&nbsp;background. There's the aforementioned HIIT, circuit training, and strength and conditioning. Then you've got cardio dance, booty bands, Pilates, and alignment. There are even a few mash-up classes in which two trainers combine their modalities into something interesting, like Copeland and Sisk's Dance and Mobility class, which combines a full-body workout with stretching and a sequence of choreography. The combo sounds like the exercise equivalent of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/wine-infused-coffee/>wine-infused coffee</a>&nbsp;to me, but I'll have to wait until next week to confirm.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Project-by-Equinox-3.jpg></p><h2>It's a cabinet of workout curiosities</h2><p>Making the studio's functionality as flexible as possible meant Equinox had&nbsp;to think outside the big-box gym model with the way Project was designed. "We needed to create a space that was the dream space for a bunch of trainers who teach very different things," Heckman says. "We got wish lists and equipment lists from every single one of them, and then we tried to get everybody exactly what they wanted."</p><p>Inside the workout studio&nbsp;is a pull-up bar, six battle rope anchors, and a mirrored wall that hides a surprising amount of equipment: rowers, sandbags, kettlebells, medicine balls, and more unique items like the Core Hammer and Donlan's booty bands.</p><p>Making the studio's functionality as flexible as possible meant Equinox needed to think outside the big-box gym model with the way Project was designed.</p><p>Overall, Project has an airy, boutique feel with industrial chic design elements and tech flourishes like digital signage and USB ports in every locker, which are located in the entry way behind the check-in desk.&nbsp;There's a retail area, bathrooms (but no formal locker rooms), and a spacious lounge where trainers (and class-goers) can hang and bounce around ideas between classes. "We're really trying to foster this collaborative feel where they feel like it’s their space," Heckman says. And Equinox, unsurprisingly, has developed an ingenious way to share the fruits of all this fitness freethinking with the world.</p><p>You may not even notice it, but in one corner of the studio, cameras, lights, and a microphone are tucked into the ceiling. From a digital interface on the wall, trainers can choose angles, length, and other factors and then use the "video booth" to film content for their social media feeds—at a quality level that far surpasses asking a rando at the gym to hold their cell phone.</p><p>So even if you can't get to a class at Project, you'll be able to start witnessing its workout breakthroughs&nbsp;in your Insta feed real soon.</p><p><strong>Now that you're feeling inspired, challenge yourself to executing the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/how-to-do-boomerang-pilates-hardest-move/>hardest move in Pilates</a> or turning your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/yoga-can-be-cardio/>next yoga session into a cardio workout</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHLpZinnJekvKV6wqikaJ2omLm2v8ivnGaooqS3pq%2FTZpmyZZWmwqq6zrFksKeioLy2wIysq66cmaR6r8XCaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
