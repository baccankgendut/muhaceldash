It’s about a girls’ orphanage and there are only two male characters. It’s really cool because the women carry this film.</p><p><b>Us: Do you relate to Janice at all?</b></p><p><b>TB</b>: Janice is vulnerable. She sees the girls running around and she can’t. But she doesn’t want sympathy, she wants to shove everyone out. I don’t want people to see me hurt, either. But I’m tougher than Janice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/annabelle-creation-91911ab3-692f-4681-9eeb-591dbf2a4fbd.jpg><p><b>Us: How did you master her limp?</b></p><p><b>TB</b>: Well, I didn’t want to go to set and wing it. So two weeks before, I started limping around my house or the grocery store with a cane. My leg got pretty sore! Now, one is probably larger than the other because I was lugging it around.</p><p><b>Us: After filming, were you more wary of dolls?</b></p><p><b>TB</b>: I don’t believe in that supernatural stuff. But dolls have a creepy smugness to them. They’re angelic looking, which freaks me out. The first time I saw the Annabelle doll was at a table read and she had her own script. I was cracking up.</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>Us: Are you a scary movie junkie?</b></p><p><b>TB</b>: I am! I watched The Shining when I was 5 or 6, and I’ve been hooked ever since. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies of all time.</p><p><b>Us: Ok, be honest: When you’re watching, are you the person who covers their eyes?</b></p><p><b>TB</b>: It depends! Sometimes I will. But with some of them I’m like, ”Are you serious? What are you doing?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Annabelle: Creation&nbsp;<i>hits theaters Friday, August 11.&nbsp;</i></p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuapJmptaJ5wZqrnqWRo3qwuoyfoKWlmaO0bq3Np5ibnZyhsm6v0Z6YraGfo3qyrYywa3JvYGyEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
