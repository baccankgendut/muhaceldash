Most actresses would squirm with embarrassment if their father watched a sex scene of theirs on-screen — but not Allison Williams. The HBO star’s famous dad, NBC Nightly News broadcaster Brian Williams, watched his daughter in a raunchy sex scene during the Girls season 4 premiere at NYC’s Lincoln Center earlier this month.
“She’s always been an actress,” Williams, 55, recently told New Yorkmagazine. “For us, watching her is the family occupation and everybody has to remember it’s aging, no animals were harmed during the filming, and ideally nobody gets hurt."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Allison went into cringeworthy detail about her character Marnie having sex with Desi (<strong>Ebon Moss-Bachrach</strong>) in the season premiere. Showing off her derriére for the world to see? No problem!</p><p>PHOTOS: Allison at the 2015 Golden Globes</p><p>“I read it in the script and I went into total action mode,” the <a href=#>Peter Pan Live!</a> star, 26, told New York mag. “I got everyone together and I was like, ‘All right, Grace [in wardrobe], you and me&nbsp;—&nbsp;we’re going to come up with something so ingenious that he is going to feel comfortable.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>And that they did. The scene asked for Moss-Bachrach to, ahem, get up close and personal with Allison’s bare bum, so she insisted that it “smell like a cake.” (No, really!) The actress smeared vanilla cream on her body while production added an invisible garment on the side “that feels like a pillow when he puts his face into it.” She added: “Total TV magic!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Allison and her dad seemed peachy keen about the whole situation, but the same couldn’t be said for her costar <strong>Jemima Kirke</strong>. The actress, who plays bohemian buddy Jessa on the Golden Globe-winning series, was left mortified at this year’s season premiere. “I sat behind Allison and her dad,” she told the mag, “and I was going to puke.”</p><p>“I was so nervous. I don’t even know him, but can you imagine?” she continued. “Watching a kissing scene with my dad next to me is awful, let alone with you getting — whatever that’s called — motorboated in your ass!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmWu27DyKWjopmdqHq4rdOcn56cXZmutrPHrZyrZZGhuaq%2FzqdkoqZdp662usKhsGafmae5tHnSnq9mq5Oau6Z5kWlobmliZnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
