It's an exclusive property, and the home that's going there matches up with it."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-273251 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/flor.jpg alt width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-273251 class=wp-caption-text>Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p><p>That will be no small feat, as the property at 2500 Gordon Drive had an impressive history going back some 80 years. In 1937, the mansion's original incarnation had nine bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and a five-car garage, as well as a residence for staff and a guesthouse. Then, in 1981 the home was purchased and demolished for the first time to make room for the mansion that went on to become the most expensive in Southwest Florida when it was sold to its undisclosed current owners. In between, it became something of an inanimate reality TV star thanks to its service as a location on the show Paradise Coast Wives.</p><p>And Austin said the entire mansion, vegetation and all, was completely scrapped:</p><p><strong>"Everything went to dump facilities. It's all recycled."</strong></p><p>He was able to keep some of the mansion's former furnishings, though, which he definitely seems pleased with:</p><p><strong>"You got to remember it was completely top-of-the-line remodeled not even 11 years ago, so there was some really killer stuff in there."</strong></p><p>Now, the next chapter in the saga of one of the most illustrious addresses in Florida is set to begin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeYqrSmeZNxZHFlnZ65rbXOp2Ssp6WptW6yy6ipopyRYrqiutKipqdlpKS%2Fr3nDqK6nZaSkeq6typ5kq6efonqnu9FmpZ6vXaS7pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
