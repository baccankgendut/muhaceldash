During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, the 41-year-old hinted that he was concerned about getting back into stripper shape for the upcoming Magic Mike 3, announced late last year. “That might be the reason why I didn’t want to do a third one, because I have to look like that,” Tatum told host Kelly Clarkson."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was candid as he told the “Since You’ve Been Gone,” 39, singer about his diet.</p><p>“It’s hard to look like that. Even if you do workout, to be that kind of in shape — it’s not natural,” Tatum, who is dating <a href=#>The Batman</a> star <a href=#><strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong></a>, said.</p><p>The One and Only Sparkella author even corrected Clarkson when she asked about “eating well,” noting that his diet isn’t recommended. “That’s not even healthy. You have to starve yourself. I don’t think when you’re that lean, it’s actually healthy,” he claimed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Channing-Tatum-Almost-Turned-Down-Magic-Mike-3-Because-He-Has-to-Starve-Himself.jpg><p>The actor, who <a href=#>shares daughter Everly</a>, 8, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Jenna Dewan</strong></a>, gave props to people who manage to stay in shape when they don’t have a Hollywood career. “I don’t know how people who work a 9 to 5 actually stay in shape because it’s my full-time job, and I can barely do it,” the 21 Jump Street star added. “If you work out twice a day, you have to eat completely right at a certain time. It’s a specific thing.”</p><p>He added that as he gets close to the day where he has “gotta be butt-naked on screen,” Tatum cuts out salt, making most food pretty bland.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Alabama native noted that he tends to stay healthier when he isn’t taking his clothes off on camera. Tatum’s weight fluctuates about 15 pounds throughout the year now, which includes when he’s <a href=#>directing movies like Dog</a>, which hit theaters Friday.</p><p>While he can’t stay in Magic Mike shape all the time, Tatum admitted that he can’t just put on weight and work if off the way he did as a twenty-something. The first-time director said it’s harder to lose weight as he gets older. Stars, they really are just like Us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonquxYymmKChk2K6qrfEZqehsaOevraxjKKqZqafqXqmwsSnZKGdkaHBqcWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
