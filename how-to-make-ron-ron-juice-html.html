That was certainly true during the original&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;series when eight guidos and guidettes were put up in a shore house for the summer.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_32>“You take eight strangers and you add alcohol and no access to the outside world besides each other and the house Duck Phone, [and] you basically get Jersey Shore,” Ortiz-Magro told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Inked Mag</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_38>Part of being on&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;meant giving up contact with friends and family — unless they were called on the Duck Phone. Private phone calls were limited to once a week, according to a former producer on the series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_31>“There was no television, no cell phones, no computers, no writing notes, no going off anywhere in private without a producer,” they explained on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Reddit</a>. “Partying was their only form of entertainment.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Ronnie was known for Ron-Ron Juice, but he preferred this vodka drink&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_20>Ironically, Ortiz-Magro’s drink of choice while he and his roommates were out clubbing had nothing to do with Ron-Ron Juice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_35>Instead, Red Bull and vodka cocktails were Ortiz-Magro’s drink of choice. Many a Red Bull and vodka led to Ortiz-Magro becoming a leader of the “Spiral Squad” — along with Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of course.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-9_28>“I can’t even drink Red Bull anymore, let’s put it that way,” he explained to Inked Mag. “Literally, even thinking about it now, I cringe. I throw up.”</p><p id=par-10_25>Still, some fans wondered if Karma served Ron-Ron Juice. More importantly, many fans wanted to know how to make some famous pre-game drinks for themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘JWoww’ came up with her own recipe for Ron-Ron Juice&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-11_17>For&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;fans wondering how to make Ron-Ron Juice at home, Jenni “JWoww” Farley came to the rescue.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_22>Ortiz-Magro’s signature pre-game drink recipe remains a mystery. However, fans have caught glimpses of some of the ingredients on episodes of&nbsp;Jersey Shore.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_20>For the most part, Ron-Ron Juice seems to be a blend of vodka, watermelon, and a few other secret ingredients.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_35>Ortiz-Magro’s roommate Farley was forced to come up with her own concoction, given how she said she “[won’t] dare ask Ron.” Her list of ingredients included Maraschino cherries, watermelon, blueberries, vodka, cranberry juice, and ice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_39>There’s one significant difference between Farley’s recipe and Ortiz-Magro’s. In Farley’s tutorial, she layered all of the ingredients into a pitcher and mashed them together by hand. On&nbsp;Jersey Shore, Ortiz-Magro would blend all of his ingredients together and serve.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_20>Another&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>recipe from MTV</a>&nbsp;calls for watermelon, strawberries, vodka, cranberry juice, watermelon juice, and a splash of fruit seltzer blended together.</p><p id=par-17_28>It’s unclear whether this is Ortiz-Magro’s official recipe or not.&nbsp;Luckily for Jersey Shore fans, there are a wealth of copy-cat recipes for Ron-Ron Juice available to follow!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMraZmpZGgsm6%2Bzqdkq6eeYre2tcKeZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
