The twosome’s on-and-off romance was a hot topic on the 2000s MTV reality series which also starred <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jason Wahler</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lo Bosworth</strong></a>.</p><p>On a July 2022 episode of the “Back to the Beach with Kristin and Stephen,” Cavallari, 36, revealed that the exes <a href=#>shared a kiss</a> during their viral August 2020 reunion. (In April 2020, Cavallari divorced <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> with whom she <a href=#>shares three children</a>: sons Camden, 10, and Jaxon, 9, and daughter Saylor, 7.)</p><p>“I posted a photo of the two of us. And that was my most liked photo of anything I’ve ever posted on Instagram. I mean, you’d beat all of my children,” Cavallari said to Colletti. “You’d beat, like, any milestone in my life. So to me, that’s actually very sweet because it shows how invested the audience was of Laguna Beach. And I think it’s really sweet.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Colletti, for his part, said that the picture had his phone blowing up for several days.</p><p>“Everyone was coming out of the woodworks asking me — there were people that were asking me kind of how I was doing, people would text me just to kind of check in. And they eventually tried to get to a casual way of like, ‘So, you’re dating anybody?’” he recalled. “And it was so obvious. I was shocked by how many people thought I was that stupid.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaa6jJympaSVqcGqecCnm2aZnJrFbsPEmq2eql2Wv6Z5xKeemp%2BVmXqistOeqWZpXa6yor6MqJ1mnJGptq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
