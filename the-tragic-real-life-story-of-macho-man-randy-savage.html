As&nbsp;<a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>&nbsp;tells us, Macho Man and Miss Elizabeth were a wrestler and his valet, but also husband and wife. This actually applied to both their in-ring roles and&nbsp;real-life situation — they got married for real in a small ceremony in 1984, and their characters followed suit in a rather more opulent in-ring ceremony at 1991's SummerSlam at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fact that their knot was doubly tied didn't translate to a "forever after" scenario. Savage was an extremely jealous man and tried to protect — or, as it often appeared, hide — Elizabeth from the prying eyes of fellow wrestlers. As a result, the locker room was quite irked by the way Savage acted — but wary of him, too. "If you even looked at Elizabeth the wrong way, then, Holy s**t," Hulk Hogan described Savage's jealous rages. "Randy would freak out. If you ever wanted to get him lit up, you'd just have to look at Liz."</p><p>If you think this was a rather unhealthy way to maintain a marriage, Miss Elizabeth ultimately agreed and filed for divorce in 1992. To add insult to injury, Savage's later WCW tenure used their divorce as part of a storyline (per <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a>).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fk25scGlfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5doq6ktM5mpJqmXaeur7DYZqqarpGcsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
